				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Molly Troxel was seven years old, she wrote this wish in a note to Dr. Edwin Stone, the Seamans-Hauser Chair in Molecular Ophthalmology at University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. Dr. Stone had already been her eye doctor for six years.</p>
<p>Molly is nine now. She lives with her mom, dad, and two sisters in Omaha, Nebraska, and she loves drawing, playing with Barbies, riding her bike, and Justin Bieber…just like any other fourth-grader.</p>
<p>But Molly has a rare inherited eye disease called Leber’s congenital amaurosis (LCA), a condition that limits her vision to 20/200, with her glasses on.<br />
LCA appears at birth or in the first few months of life and affects around 1 in 80,000 of the population.<br />
When she wears contacts, her vision improves to 20/100.</p>
<p>“Everybody knows that Molly is visually impaired except Molly,” laughed her mom, Laura Troxel.</p>
<p>Molly comes to Iowa City to see Dr. Stone once a year, and because of the research that he and his team are pursuing in the Iowa Institute for Vision Research (IVR), Molly and her family have real hope that her vision may be restored someday.</p>
<p>“There is no cure for LCA yet,” said Laura. “But because of Dr. Stone, we believe that there can be—and that it can happen in Molly’s lifetime.”</p>
<p>LCA, caused by multiple genes, has been successfully treated with gene therapy. In fact, doctors in the UI Laboratory for Gene Discovery have pinpointed the gene that causes Molly’s type of LCA—a breakthrough that brings them closer than ever to being able to restore her vision.</p>
<p>“I’ll never forget the first time we brought Molly to the UI. She was barely a year old,” Laura continued. “Dr. Stone told us the story of a dog named Lancelot with LCA, who had regained sight as a result of gene therapy—and then he assured us that he and his team were doing everything in their power to make sure that human patients like Molly would have access to effective gene therapy, too.”</p>
<p>Molly’s dad agrees. “At first we were afraid, leery, and not sure what to do,” said Ryan Troxel. “Dr. Stone and the other doctors and nurses not only made time for us and reassured us, but they have already made amazing progress in their research in the short time Molly has been a patient here.”</p>
<p>Molly’s note has been scanned, copied, and shared multiple times—across the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, within the labs of the IVR, in PowerPoint presentations by the department, and even in the hallways of the UI Foundation, where private funds are raised to support these areas—because it so eloquently expresses what inspires Dr. Stone and his fellow UI visual-sciences colleagues to keep pushing their work to the next level.</p>
<p>These top-tier physicians and researchers have won countless awards and continue to make innumerable advances toward their common goal of preventing and curing blinding eye diseases for good. They are among the best in the world, and any number of them could actually be in the running for a Nobel Prize some day.</p>
<p>But they don’t do it for the honors and accolades. Their breakthroughs are inspired by the wish of a little girl—and every patient like her—who simply wants to see.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Since 1981, more than 300 students have been awarded the Barry Freeman Fellowship, which helps UI medical students conduct hands-on medical work or research in Third World countries.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2014/04/freeman.gif" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="freeman" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p><img style="padding: 0 0 10px 10px;" alt="Bob and Marion Freeman" width="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2014/04/freeman.gif" align="right" />When Robert (1950 B.S.P.E) and Marion Freeman lost their son Barry in 1972, they wondered what to do with the memorial gifts that came pouring in. At the time of his death, Barry was in his first year of medical school at the University of Iowa, so the couple called the dean of what is now known as the UI Roy J. and Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine, and after getting feedback from Barry’s classmates, purchased some furniture for a student lounge and created an emergency loan fund for medical students.</p>
<p>“That’s how we started,” says Marion. “And then, when people asked ‘what can we do?,’ we encouraged them to give to the college.”</p>
<p>Many people would have felt satisfied with what was a generous—and valuable—gift to support Barry’s classmates. But with that gift, the Freemans merely “started” what would turn into more than 40 years of giving that has supported generations of UI Carver College of Medicine students and reaches across departments and around the globe. All while creating a lasting legacy to honor their son.</p>
<p>Barry Freeman grew up in Iowa City, as did his parents, and received his Bachelor of Science degree at Iowa in 1972 before being accepted into the medical program the following fall. On December 8 of that same year, Barry was walking on campus near Hardin library—he was on his way to an exam—when he was killed in a tragic accident near a construction site.</p>
<p>“Barry was a wonderful son,” says Bob. “He was an excellent student; he was inquisitive, fun-loving, and determined to be a physician.”</p>
<p>The Freemans say they gave to Iowa—and continue to give—to honor the type of person Barry was. And as they’ve continued to grow the fund throughout the years, they’ve encouraged others to give, too. A few years ago, the Freemans initiated a challenge to UI Carver College of Medicine alumni—including those who had benefitted from the fellowship—and matched the money raised several times over.</p>
<p>The couple also recently established a bequest in their estate plans that will support the fund, and ensure Barry’s legacy continues in perpetuity.</p>
<p>“We’re proud of this gift,” says Bob. “It helps people in need, it helps med students get a better education, and the college uses it as a recruitment tool. We feel good about helping in honor of Barry.”</p>
<p>Today, what started out as an emergency fund that granted no-interest, emergency loans to medical students has blossomed into a multi-faceted fund that supports a number of important programs and initiatives.</p>
<p>Since 1981, more than 300 students have been awarded the Barry Freeman Fellowship, which helps UI medical students conduct hands-on medical work or research in Third World countries.</p>
<p>Michael Ross, M.D., (1997 M.D.) was one of those students. He received the fellowship twice during his time at Iowa and says the experiences were life changing.</p>
<p>“The feeling I had when I arrived in Africa will never leave me,” says Dr. Ross. “I grew up in a small town in Iowa, and all of a sudden found myself trying to get to a small village in Africa. I was overwhelmed but so excited.”</p>
<p>Dr. Ross is grateful to the Freemans for investing in UI students and has joined them by contributing to the fund as well.</p>
<p>“I am happy to give back. My fellowship experiences really changed me as a person, helped me discover myself, and gave me a global perspective that I did not have before,” says Dr. Ross. “I am the person I am today because of the UI, and specifically because of the Barry Freeman Fund.</p>
<p>Robin Paetzold, director of global programs for the UI Carver College of Medicine, works with fellowship recipients and sees firsthand the impact the Freemans’ giving has on students.</p>
<p>“I really admire what the Freemans have done for the college and our students,” says Robin. “We have such a strong global program, and it started with their gift. Having this opportunity for our students, it definitely is a wonderful recruitment tool, and the students feel so supported—not just because of the financial help—but I think they really feel like someone’s looking out for them and paving the way. ”</p>
<p>Students who receive the fellowship must spend a minimum of 8 weeks at an international medically underserved site, under the supervision of a health care provider who has extensive knowledge and expertise as well as a formal tie to the site. At the conclusion of the project, fellows write up a final report, which is shared with the Freemans.</p>
<p>“We have hundreds of thank-you cards,” says Marion. “And each year, we look forward to receiving those reports—it’s so interesting to read them and learn what students are doing,”</p>
<p>Robin says it’s a way to give the Freemans a window into the world of the people they are helping.</p>
<p>“The Freemans are trusting students they don’t know to go into places they’ll never see, and provide critical aid. It’s really remarkable.”</p>
<p>The Freemans’ fund supports other initiatives—those emergency loans continue and are designed to be a stopgap for things like rent, unexpected medical expenses, or other financial hardships. The loans are offered with no interest, and students arrange a payback schedule when they take the loan. Since nearly all of the more than 500 loans that have been made so far have been repaid, that fund self-replenishes and continues to serve students today. The Freemans’ gift also supports a medical Spanish program, which provides 6-week courses in conversational Spanish each semester.</p>
<p>Although the impact of the Freemans’ giving is felt far and wide, Bob says the reason he and Marion give is a simple one:</p>
<p>“We’re just trying to do the things Barry would have done if he would have lived.”</p>

<p>The three-year starting long snapper for the Iowa Hawkeyes football team was a three-sport standout in football, wrestling, and track and field at Central High School in DeWitt, Iowa. He also played baseball. Casey’s father, Kurt, was his high school coach and played football and wrestled for Augustana College in Rock Island, Illinois.</p>
<p>“My goal in life has always been to give myself the best opportunities I could,” says Casey.<br />
After spending two days on campus in Iowa City, while narrowing the options for college, he and his parents knew that the University of Iowa was the best match for him. On Casey’s visit they met with faculty at the college of education and discovered a family atmosphere. “It was clear to me that at Iowa, if you worked hard both on and off the field, you could realize rewards,” he says.</p>
<p>Entering the world of division one college football proved to be a huge transition, however.</p>
<p>“When I began my college football career, I invested a lot of time and energy in the sport,” says Casey. “I was invited in as a walk-on; I had a lot to learn and a lot to prove. Frankly, I wasn’t doing my best in my academics. But my parents challenged me, and caused me to reflect on why I had chosen Iowa.”<br />
The challenge paid off, both on and off the field.</p>
<p>Casey was named to the Big Ten Academic All-Conference team three straight years, from 2011 to 2013 and, along the way, emerged from walk-on to athletic scholarship recipient. He received support from an Arthur E. Stanley Football Scholarship in 2012, and received the Janice and Kevin Moss Scholarship in 2013.</p>
<p>“My scholarships really helped me focus my efforts on my academics and football, and not worry so much about the cost of my education,” he says.</p>
<p>Casey earned a B.S. degree in Science Education in 2013. He has completed two practicums: at West Branch Middle School, and at Iowa City Regina High School. During the winter of 2013-14, while training and preparing for a potential career in the National Football League, Casey worked as an intern for the Athletic Development Office at the University of Iowa Foundation.</p>
<p>“Working at the foundation has been valuable,” says Casey.  “I can see the positive impact of philanthropy from many new perspectives.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2014/03/harmeyer.png" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="harmeyer" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p><img style="padding: 0 0 10px 10px;" alt="Harmeyer Family" width="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2014/03/harmeyer.png" align="right" /><br />
Chuck and Cecelia Harmeyer didn’t go to the University of Iowa. But their love for the Hawkeyes—they’ve been season ticket holders for football and basketball for more than 30 years—is evident. So it wasn’t a surprise to the Harmeyers when two of their three children chose Iowa for their undergraduate education: daughter Melissa graduated from the UI in 2008 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history and communication studies, and son Michael graduated in 2010 with a B.A. in cinema and communication studies (daughter Erin is currently a doctoral candidate at the University of Missouri).</p>
<p>In appreciation for Melissa and Michael’s time at the UI, the couple has decided to give back to Iowa by naming the University of Iowa Foundation as a beneficiary of their life insurance policy.</p>
<p>“Cecelia and I came from families where both giving and education were important,” says Chuck. “Since we’re both native Iowans, and helping provide educational opportunities is important to us, giving to the University of Iowa is a natural because we believe that the UI provides the best postsecondary education in the state.”</p>
<p>The Harmeyers’ gift will create two scholarship funds in the UI College of Liberal Arts and Sciences: the <strong>Melissa Harmeyer Scholarship</strong> in the UI Department of History, and the <strong>Michael D. Harmeyer Scholarship</strong> in the UI Department of Cinema and Comparative Literature. The endowed funds will create annual scholarships for one or more students in each of the respective departments—a tribute, Chuck says, to Iowa and to his children.</p>
<p>“Once we decided to give to the university, establishing the scholarships in Melissa and Michael’s names came easy,” says Chuck. “The UI played a great part in our children’s development that carries over into their lives today. And, these funds are also our way of recognizing the work that Melissa and Michael put forward while in school.”</p>
<p>According to the couple, naming the UI Foundation as a beneficiary of a life insurance policy was an easy way to give. “It represented a very painless way of giving something of value to the university,” says Chuck. “We never really assumed use of those funds in any of our personal financial planning.”</p>
<p>Overall, the Harmeyers are pleased with their decision to give to Iowa.</p>
<p>“Anytime something benefits you or touches your life in a positive way, then you should do whatever you can to help or assist that organization,” says Chuck. “Plus, providing educational opportunities to young people only ensures a better future for us all.”</p>
<p>And it’s safe to say his children are equally enthused about the gift.</p>
<p>“When I first told Melissa about the gift, she told me one thing: that she felt honored and proud,” says Chuck. “As parents, anytime we can make our children feel this way, we should aspire to do so.”</p>

		<description><![CDATA[“I wasn’t really sure what I wanted to do for research or anything, but I knew I wanted to work in Maurine’s lab. The people here are awesome,” says Sullivan. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/11/sullivan.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="sullivan" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Ask a child to describe the ideal vacation activity, and several responses—from swimming to sandcastles—are likely. But for Michelle Sullivan, the fun wasn’t to be found splashing in the waves or basking in the sun.</p>
<p>“When we went on vacation as kids, my sister wanted to go to the beach,” says Sullivan. “I wanted to go on the educational boat tour.”</p>
<p>Sullivan’s journey from wide-eyed young tourist to senior honors biology major at the University of Iowa has been every bit as rich in learning experiences—and as full of interesting stops—as those boat tours on vacation.</p>
<p>In addition to a major in biology, Sullivan, of Urbandale, Iowa, will complete a minor in dance when she graduates from the UI in the spring of 2014. She also works as a yoga instructor, including at University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics for a cancer survivors group.</p>
<p>Responsible for her own college expenses, Sullivan’s jobs—which also include work at the UI Museum of Natural History, and as a tour guide for prospective UI students and their families through the admissions office—have helped offset the expense of pursuing her degree. And although she enjoys her work, she knows it takes her away from the lab time her research requires.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2013, the burden of balancing jobs and research was lightened when Sullivan received a <strong>John and Elsie Mae Ferentz Undergraduate Fellowship for Research</strong>, which allowed her to cut back on work and devote more time to the lab.</p>
<p>Sullivan also currently receives financial support from the <strong>Alexander Kern Liberal Arts and Sciences Scholarship</strong>, and previous scholarship support has helped her throughout her time at Iowa. Aside from wanting to pursue an advanced degree upon graduation, Sullivan isn’t sure where her road may lead her. She’s fine with that, though, and she embraces the uncertainty.</p>
<p>In fact, it was that same open-mindedness that led her to the field of biology in the first place. Sullivan entered the UI with plans to major in mathematics. But an honors project in biological mathematical modeling in the first semester of her freshman year changed her mind.</p>
<p>After switching her major and settling into the honors biology program, Sullivan met UI Assistant Professor of Biology Maurine Neiman. And while she had yet to decide on her specific research interest, she was sure she wanted to work with Neiman.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t really sure what I wanted to do for research or anything, but I knew I wanted to work in Maurine’s lab. The people here are awesome,” says Sullivan.</p>
<p>Among the things Sullivan has learned from researching under Neiman is the importance of becoming a public scientist.</p>
<p>“We need smart people of all kinds to be scientists,” says Neiman. “We have a role as scientists to communicate to the public why what we’re doing is important, and people like Michelle can go out and be advocates for our work.”</p>
<p>To summarize Sullivan’s research—evaluating the mutational hypotheses for persistence of sex in sexual/asexual systems by studying a freshwater snail native to New Zealand lakes and streams—is to understand the importance of helping the public understand it. With parents who are social workers and a sister who is majoring in vocal performance, Sullivan finds ways to practice communicating her work—or “bridging the sciences and humanities,” as she describes it—in a way that public science demands. And she knows doing so is the best way she can think of to thank the UI contributors responsible for the private support she’s received at the UI.</p>
<p>“Donors’ generosity is my motivation to suck every minute out of my UI experience that I can,” she says. “It inspires me to take my education, turn it around, and give it back to the community.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/10/fenton.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="fenton" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Through nearly two distinguished decades at the University of Iowa College of Nursing, Dean Emeritus Geraldene Felton led, taught, and cared for countless faculty, students, and patients. But her history of service—to her profession and her country—dates back even farther.</p>
<p><img style="float: right; padding: 8px;" alt="" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/10/fenton.jpg" width="320" /></p>
<p>Born in Norfolk, Virginia, in 1926 and raised in Philadelphia by her mother, Felton joined the U.S. Army Nurse Corps in 1949. She served as a staff nurse until 1956 and went on to hold a variety of additional teaching and clinical positions, including nursing supervisor, nurse anesthetist, and deputy director of the Department of Nursing at Walter Reed Institute of Research. Following her retirement from the Army Nurse Corps in 1975, Felton became professor and dean of nursing at Oakland University School of Nursing in Rochester, Michigan. It was at Oakland University that Felton met David Evans, who she later married. David Evans died in 2001.</p>
<p>Felton came to the University of Iowa in 1981 to serve as professor and dean of the UI College of Nursing. She retired in 1997, though she continued to serve as a consultant on nursing education and nursing research at various colleges and universities. Among her many accomplishments as dean of the UI College of Nursing was building a research-based program at the college, which included hiring Ph.D. faculty, building research programs, and starting the UI College of Nursing Ph.D. program.</p>
<p>In 2013, Felton made a bequest to the UI College of Nursing to establish the <strong>Geraldene Felton Graduate Student Scholarship Fund</strong>, which is intended to provide financial support for graduate students in nursing.</p>
<p>“It is an honor to designate funds for advanced nursing education at the University of Iowa College of Nursing,” says Felton. “Support for students to pursue advanced degrees is vital to the future of the college and its ability to continue recruiting the best and brightest students to Iowa.”</p>
<p>Felton’s establishment of the fund continues a legacy of philanthropy to the UI College of Nursing. Because of her longtime support of the college through annual gifts to the Nursing Progress Fund, Felton also is a member of the Presidents Club, which recognizes the University of Iowa’s most generous contributors. The Nursing Progress Fund provides unrestricted support for the college to take advantage of special opportunities as they arise, or lend a hand where nursing students, faculty, and staff need it most—something Felton has done through her lifetime of service and philanthropy.</p>
<p>Thanks to her gift to establish the Geraldene Felton Graduate Student Scholarship Fund, her generosity will endure and influence countless generations of future nursing students.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/gruneich.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="gruneich" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Park City, Utah</p>
<p>Kevin Gruneich didn&#8217;t have any big advantages growing up as a middle-class kid in Montezuma, Iowa. The son of a Presbyterian minister and a part-time secretary/homemaker, Kevin paid his own way through college at the UI, having begun working and saving as early as grade school. But he didn&#8217;t do it alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had some obstacles to overcome but they were modest compared to the obstacles other students face—especially minority and first-generation college students.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Kevin now gives generously to support students from underrepresented minority groups at The University of Iowa. In addition to creating the Kevin Gruneich Opportunity at Iowa Scholarship Fund, he is also underwriting <a href="http://http://diversity.uiowa.edu/cde/get-iowa-edge" target="_blank"><strong>The Iowa Edge</strong></a>, a  program that strives to provide orientation, programming, community-building, and counseling support for minority and first-generation college students new to the UI.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am just beginning to return the investment others have made in me,&#8221; he explains, and he hopes that his philanthropy will multiply with future generations. &#8220;I believe the students I help will eventually also be there to help others, creating a virtuous cycle that will improve the University, the state, and society as a whole.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Kevin, there&#8217;s something special about young people just getting started in their lives and careers. &#8220;The undergraduate years are so important,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;What one experiences, learns, and practices during college, along with the momentum coming out of this period, is key to attaining life goals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks to scholarships provided with the help of friends like Kevin Gruneich, deserving UI students will have no trouble building up speed toward reaching those goals.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="620" height="746" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/08/melly.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="Melissa Dixon" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Countless University of Iowa student-athletes share stories about childhoods spent dreaming of one day being a Hawkeye—donning the black and gold, listening to the roar of the crowd, celebrating with teammates after a big win.</p>
<p>But for women’s basketball junior guard Melissa Dixon, the Hawkeye dreams didn’t start until much later.</p>
<p>In fact, Dixon’s first real exposure to the University of Iowa came on a visit to campus as a high school basketball standout from Johnsburg, Illinois. She fell in love immediately, and knew right away that Iowa was where she wanted to be.</p>
<p>“I just loved everyone I met, from the women on the team to the coaches. I just had a really good feeling after visiting here,” says Dixon.</p>
<p>The feeling was so good, in fact, that Dixon chose to enroll at the UI and join the women’s basketball team without the promise of a scholarship, prepared to bide her time on the practice squad if necessary. Fortunately, she never had to do so. Dixon received word of a scholarship offer during her senior year in high school.</p>
<p>While at Iowa, Melissa was awarded the Kris Rogers Memorial Scholarship. Kris Rogers excelled as a Hawkeye student-athlete in softball and basketball from 1976 to 1982. Rogers, who became a successful local businesswoman after graduating from the UI in 1983, died of cancer in 1994 at the age of 36. Contributions made in her memory by family and friends helped establish the endowed scholarship in her name at the UI Foundation, honoring a legacy that student-athletes like Melissa Dixon are proud to continue.</p>
<p>A recreation and sports business major, Dixon had a chance to take her Iowa experience beyond the classroom throughout the summer of 2013 with an internship opportunity at the UI Foundation. She was able to see firsthand the impact of private support on student-athletes.</p>
<p>Melissa Dixon has enjoyed plenty of success as a Hawkeye on the court as well as off. Her 2012-2013 basketball season included:<br />
• Big 10 Sixth Player of the Year Award<br />
• Led the Hawkeyes in scoring during conference play<br />
• During conference play, led the Big 10 in three-point percentage, including finishing second in three-pointers made<br />
• Tied the school record for three-pointers made by an Iowa player in Carver-Hawkeye Arena</p>

Natives of Iowa City, the two met at Iowa City High School in the 1930s, but financial circumstances prevented them from pursuing college at that time.</p>
<p>“George always wanted to attend the University of Iowa, and he did for a while after high school. But he wasn&#8217;t able to afford to continue,” says Margaret. “George said he always wanted to create a scholarship for graduates of Iowa City High School.”</p>
<p>After George and Margaret graduated from Iowa City High School in 1938, George served in the United States Navy during World War II. The couple was married in Iowa City in 1941. George worked for the United States Post Office—including service as the Postmaster of North Liberty—until his retirement in 1978. Margaret worked for the University of Iowa—first in the business office and then for the athletics ticket office—until retiring in 1985. Avid Hawkeye fans, the Maxeys regularly attended football and basketball games well into their retirement. They were married for a month shy of 70 years before George’s death in 2010.</p>
<p>Although the Maxeys did not obtain degrees from the UI themselves, their names will forever be linked to helping others do so. In 2011—after reviewing finances upon George’s passing—Margaret Maxey decided to endow the George and Margaret Maxey Scholarship to help Iowa City High School students realize their college dreams.</p>
<p>The scholarship is specifically intended to benefit students from Iowa City High School who demonstrate financial need, helping to, as Margaret puts it, “create a bright future for persons who otherwise could not afford college.”</p>

<p>Mark Bogue of Ida Grove, Iowa graduated from the University of Iowa in 1982 with a B.S. in civil engineering with an emphasis in structural design. Following graduation he worked in Peoria, Illinois for Caterpillar Tractor Company. He credits Caterpillar’s extensive training program for preparing him for the multitude of tasks an engineer needs to be prepared for in either working for a large company or managing his own business.</p>
<p>He moved on from there to Dallas, Texas where he took a position with Texas Instruments in the early stages of the production of the HARM missile. During this time he married Jaclyn, a 1983 University of Iowa graduate from the business college.</p>
<p>After a few years in Dallas and some discussion of starting a family, they decided to accept an offer from his father to return back to Iowa and become involved in Hi-Way Products, Inc., a business that his father started in 1969. Hi-Way Products, Inc. was a growing business and at a stage to expand its product line and geographic sales area. Hi-Way</p>
<p>Products, Inc. is the leading supplier of custom fabricated steel products for the highway bridge industry and highway guardrail and safety products utilized on bridges and along roadways in Iowa. They represent steel fabricators in four different states.</p>
<p>In 1999 Mark and his father had grown the business to the point where they felt it necessary to own their own steel fabrication company. Hawkeye Fabrication, Inc. was started that year and has become a successful part of their corporate strategy. In 2000 Mark and Jaclyn purchased both of the businesses from his father. Mark is currently the president of both companies.</p>
<p>The I-235 Interstate Reconstruction project through Des Moines, Iowa during 2003 to 2008 is a project that his companies are extremely proud of, with approximately 40 bridges utilizing their decorative fabricated handrails and other products.</p>
<p>Mark and Jaclyn have three children and they are very proud to say they are all Hawkeyes! Two sons , both of which have recently graduated from the college of engineering and a daughter that is currently a sophomore in the Health Sciences.</p>
<p>Mark enjoys getting involved with organizations he believes in. He has been an involved member of the College of Engineering Development Council for over 10 years. In late 2012, he accepted the position as Chair of the Engineering Campaign Task Force for the “For Iowa. Forever More” campaign.</p>
<p>Mark has also served on the BC-IG Community School Board for eight years, serving as vice president for four of those years. He was a member of the Ida Grove Community Fire Dept. for thirteen years. He has also achieved the rank of 3rd Degree Black belt in Tae Kwon Do.</p>
<p>He enjoys boating, water and snow skiing, bicycling, motorcycling, collecting fine wines and travel.</p>
<p><em><strong>“With three generations of U of I engineering graduates in our family, we take great pride in being involved and giving back financially to the college that has given our family so many wonderful opportunities. We understand that the college can utilize our support in numerous ways to benefit the next generation of engineering students. Jacki and I truly believe that the college motto of educating &#8220;Engineers&#8230; and something more&#8221; is developing the most versatile engineers for the future.”</strong></em></p>

Hanson" width="106" height="166" class="size-full wp-image-406" align="right" style="padding-left:10px;" />A native of Moline, IL, Tom Hanson graduated from The University of Iowa in 1960 in mechanical engineering. Following graduation, he worked for Union Carbide Corporation in Charleston, WV. Hanson’s career then led him to The Trane Company, La Crosse, WI, and another firm in Winston-Salem, NC. Three years later, Hanson moved to suburban Chicago, where he ran the regional sales office of York International. After years in the heating and cooling industry, he integrated his expertise in engineering, business, sales, and communications and started his own company in 1980, Fleming Hanson Sales. The Chicago-based company, from which Hanson retired in 2000, contracts with various heating and cooling manufacturers as exclusive regional sales representatives.</p>
<p>Inspired by his own career experiences and deep commitment to his alma mater, Hanson and his wife, Nancy, endowed the Hanson Center for Technical Communication in the College of Engineering. Through this innovative center, today’s students have a comprehensive resource for developing excellent communication skills as part of the engineering education – skills Hanson felt were too often missing among engineers. He especially enjoys staying in touch with the student peer consultants and staff members so he can observe the progress this unique center is making.</p>
<p>Hanson served as a member and chair of the College of Engineering Development Council during the Good. Better. Best. Iowa campaign and is currently Chair of The University of Iowa Foundation Board of Directors. In 2010, he received The University of Iowa Alumni Association Distinguished Alumni Award for Service.</p>
<p><strong><em>“I give to the College of Engineering because I know private support is essential to funding the College’s commitment to providing the highest quality educational experience for its students.  Whether that means new facilities, new programs, scholarships or student travel opportunities, private support makes it happen. The knowledge that my support makes a positive difference in the education these students receive is highly gratifying.”</strong></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="320" height="200" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/06/sweda.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="Dr. Michael Sweda" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p><img class="size-full wp-image-400" style="padding-left: 10px;" alt="Dr. Michael Sweda" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/06/sweda-300x187.jpg" width="320" height="200" align="right" />For UI alumnus Dr. Michael Sweda (1984 M.A., 1988 Ph.D.), connecting with Professor Jacob Sines in 1981 was a turning point in his graduate studies.</p>
<p>“I was thinking of leaving graduate school in psychology to become a lawyer,” says Sweda. “I can still remember the day he put his arm around my shoulder and said, ‘Young man, let’s talk about your future.’”</p>
<p>That conversation led to Dr. Sweda’s long and successful career in forensic psychology, and recently, a generous gift to the UI in memory of his trusted mentor.</p>
<p>Now a board-certified forensic psychologist with more than twenty-five years of professional experience, Sweda is currently the director and developer of the first and only postdoctoral training program in forensic psychology to gain accreditation through the American Psychological Association: Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, located in Bethesda, Maryland.</p>
<p>“I have the great honor of being a civilian serving to train active duty Army psychologists in becoming forensic psychologists and in testifying in courts-martial across the country and throughout the world.”</p>
<p>He wanted to give back to the UI so that others could receive the outstanding education that helped him succeed. That’s why Dr. Sweda included a charitable bequest in his estate plans to establish the <b>Jacob O. Sines Professorship in the UI Department of Psychology</b>.</p>
<p>“Jake Sines is the reason I am a forensic psychologist today,” Sweda says.  “He was a superb teacher who was beloved by students for his thought-provoking, engaging style of teaching.”</p>
<p>Because of Dr. Sweda’s visionary gift, generations of faculty—and their students—will benefit.</p>
<p>“I am reminded daily in my professional practice of the outstanding education I received,” says Sweda. “Iowa Psychology has a long history of excellence in research and dedication to training of their small group of select graduate students. I wanted to give back and help continue that tradition.”</p>
<p>His gift connects that tradition of excellence with the potential of the future.</p>
<p>“As Walt Whitman said, ‘past and present and future are not disjoined but joined,’” says Sweda. “By giving, you help join past, present, and future in a way that is meaningful to those who came before, those you know, and those yet to come.”</p>

<p>For years Edna and Earl Yoder of Iowa City have been like family to Hawkeye football players.</p>
<p>&#8220;My parents have been mentors and friends for hundreds of Hawkeye football players,&#8221; says the Yoders&#8217; daughter, Jeanne Auen (1992 M.A.) of Drakesville, Iowa. &#8220;My mom and dad still get Mother&#8217;s Day and Father&#8217;s Day cards from players from long ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because of the Yoders&#8217; warm personal connection to Iowa football&#8212;and the many other ways that Earl and Edna have shown their loyalty and dedication to The University of Iowa&#8212;their family created the <strong>Edna and Earl Yoder Football Scholarship</strong> in their honor.</p>
<p>Jeanne and her husband, Stephen Auen (1978 B.A., 1982 M.A., 1990 Ph.D.), joined with another of the Yoders&#8217; daughters, Barbara King of Lake Charles, Louisiana, and her husband, Randall, to pay tribute to the Yoders&#8217; generosity of spirit, time, and financial resources. </p>
<p>&#8220;My parents have always done so much for the UI and so much for us,&#8221; Jeanne explained. &#8220;We wanted to give something back that would be especially meaningful to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earl is the president of Iowa City Ready Mix and Earl Yoder Construction company. He has a long history of civic involvement, including at the UI. Among other accomplishments, he was co-chair of the Hawkeye Horizons Campaign in the early 1990s, is a Lifetime Honorary Director of the UI Foundation, and is a charter member of the Kinnick Society. He was named Hawk of the Year in 1985 and received the Distinguished Friend of the University Award from the UI Alumni Association in 1997.</p>
<p>The Hawkeyes have always been close to the Yoders&#8217; hearts. And now, thanks to their family&#8217;s thoughtfulness, their name will be forever linked to athletic excellence at Iowa.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/wolfson.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="wolfson" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Iowa City, Iowa</p>
<p>Sherwood and Sara Wolfson have been part of The University of Iowa and Iowa City since they joined the UI faculty in 1971. Sara chaired the home economics department, taught in the College of Education, and served as UI associate vice president for academic affairs. Sherwood held a joint appointment in the College of Dentistry and the VA Medical Center.</p>
<p>Both are now faculty emeriti, still active in the life of their University&#8212;and they wouldn&#8217;t dream of leaving the Iowa City community.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve never contemplated retiring anyplace else,&#8221; Sherwood says. &#8220;The whole University environment is wonderful.&#8221; </p>
<p>For instance, the couple have been avid Hancher enthusiasts, attending an eclectic variety of performances each year since they arrived at the UI. </p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s very little we don&#8217;t like at Hancher,&#8221; Sara says. &#8220;It&#8217;s a big part of life here. It makes Iowa City more livable and intellectually stimulating.&#8221;</p>
<p>As both faculty and community members, the Wolfsons have seen firsthand the benefits of private support for the UI, so they long ago <strong>made a pledge to themselves to give annually</strong> to a number of UI areas&#8212;including Hancher&#8212;that they believe contribute to the community&#8217;s unique atmosphere. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s a pledge they&#8217;ve kept faithfully, for more than 30 years. And in recent years, they were able to <strong>expand their sustaining annual support by taking advantage of the <a href="http://www.gftpln.org/Article.do?orgId=158&amp;articleId=14712">federal charitable IRA roll-over provision</a></strong>. The provision allows people 70.5 years or more of age to &#8220;roll over&#8221; IRA assets directly to a qualified charity such as The University of Iowa Foundation&#8212;<strong>without declaring the withdrawn funds as taxable income</strong>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We took our required minimum distribution,&#8221; Sherwood says, &#8220;and used it to support programs we believe in.&#8221; </p>
<p>With their tax-free funds, the Wolfsons gave to Hancher (they point out that there&#8217;s no way Hancher can afford such great entertainment on ticket prices alone, and they love its statewide educational programming) as well as to the UI colleges where they taught.</p>
<p>And their generosity didn&#8217;t stop there. These committed donors also gave generously to the UI Museum of Art and to several UI academic programs with which they were not associated professionally, but for which they have great respect.</p>
<p>The Wolfsons would have given anyway, as they do every year, simply <strong>because they believe it&#8217;s important</strong>. But with the charitable IRA roll-over provision (the provision expires at the end of 2011 under current law), they were able to reach a little further with their support.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d absolutely recommend it to anyone,&#8221; Sherwood says of their decision to take advantage of the IRA roll-over provision. &#8220;It just makes good sense.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/law2.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="College of Law" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Bethesda, Maryland</p>
<p>Duane &#8220;Bud&#8221; Vieth (1947 J.D.) attributes much of his success to being in the right place at the right time.</p>
<p>For him, the UI College of Law was one of those &#8220;right places&#8221;&#8212;and now he&#8217;s decided the time is right to give back to the college.</p>
<p>Bud knew that <a href="http://www.gftpln.org/stelterweb/CategoryDetailList.do?orgId=158&#038;categoryId=234">IRA funds</a> are some of the best assets to use for charitable gifts because of their tax impact. So using some of his IRA assets, which had accumulated beyond his needs, Bud recently made a substantial lead gift to establish the N. William Hines Professorship Fund. Although Bud had originally planned on a deferred gift, a unique tax-free circumstance enabled him to give the IRA funds outright&#8212;<a href="/gp/vol1/email.html">a situation now offered to all under the Pension Protection Act of 2006</a>.</p>
<p>In turn, Bud&#8217;s gift honoring Hines&#8217;s retirement after 28 years as dean of the UI College of Law encouraged other friends and colleagues to give to the professorship, making it a community effort.</p>
<p>Says Bud about his generous contribution, &#8220;I feel a great sense of gratitude toward the law school for the important role it has played in my career. I always believed in doing something in return.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like many of his contemporaries, as a young man, Bud took time out from studies to serve in World War II. By the time he attended law school, he says, &#8220;I was older than the average law student is today. At that time, the school was exploding and didn&#8217;t have enough professors to handle all the students.&#8221; To meet the demand, legendary law dean Mason Ladd hired recent grads from Ivy League schools to join the Iowa faculty. &#8220;Many of them were only a year or two older than I was,&#8221; says Bud, &#8220;and some, like Bob Hunt, became my good friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>When it was time to look for a job, Hunt suggested that Bud try the relatively new law firm of Arnold, Fortas &#038; Porter in Washington, D.C. Thanks to his tip, Bud became the eighth lawyer hired by the firm&#8212;where he practiced for more than 40 years, specializing in antitrust and trade regulation, corporate and securities, and litigation. He served for 17 years as managing partner and later as chairman, until his semi-retirement in 1989. The well-established law office now boasts hundreds of lawyers, and offices in six cities, including London and Brussels. The firm honored Bud by establishing a scholarship in his name in the UI College of Law.</p>
<p>Characteristic of his low-key nature, Bud&#8217;s own gifts to the college have created two awards named in honor of others. In addition to the Hines Professorship, he established The Hunt Prize in American Legal History, commemorating Professor Robert S. Hunt, the good friend and mentor who helped get his law career started.</p>
<p>Bud&#8217;s gift of IRA assets to establish the Hines Professorship remains his main legacy at the University. &#8220;Bill Hines was an outstanding leader, and I was delighted to contribute in this way,&#8221; says Bud, who served with Hines on the Law School Board of Directors for many years. </p>
<p>These generous contributions will help ensure the future excellence of the college that gave Bud the right start&#8212;which makes them just the right gifts at the right time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/tippie.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="tippie" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Austin, Texas</p>
<p>It all began in 1954 with a $5 check. Henry B. Tippie, then a recent University of Iowa business graduate, put the gift in an envelope and mailed it off to his alma mater. The Belle Plaine, Iowa, native had just begun a tradition that would one day become a $30 million commitment.</p>
<p>The Iowa farm boy went from attending a one-room schoolhouse to making a financial contribution so generous that the UI named an entire college in his honor.</p>
<p>But getting this Iowan-turned-Texan to the Henry B. Tippie College of Business was a journey that started long before the $5 check.</p>
<p>After serving in the Army Air Force during World War II, Tippie enrolled at the University on the GI Bill, earning a B.S.C. degree in 1949. He worked for accounting firms in Des Moines and Omaha and later moved to Delaware to work for Rollins and Associates.</p>
<p>Throughout the years, Tippie has built his reputation as a shrewd and diverse manager and as an investor in a variety of enterprises such as transportation, communications, pest control, oil and gas, cattle ranching, gaming, and NASCAR.</p>
<p>Today, Tippie is a Texas cattle rancher and chairman of the board and its executive committee of Dover Motorsports, Inc., and Dover Downs Gaming and Entertainment, Inc. He also is chairman, president, and CEO of Tippie Services, Inc., a management services company.</p>
<p>However, no matter what his town or title, Tippie has contributed to the UI, supporting everything from athletics to Old Capitol.</p>
<p>Through gifts large and small, he and his wife, Patricia, have built a tradition of UI generosity that is as big-hearted as the state they now call home.</p>
<p>&#8220;I benefited beyond all expectations by attending The University of Iowa,&#8221; Tippie says. &#8220;My wife and I are honored by the opportunity to make a repayment and assist in the growth of the University and the College of Business.&#8221;</p>

		<description><![CDATA["Thanks to the variety of subject matter and media, there is something for everyone in a good library, if you're willing to explore."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/libraries1.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="libraries1" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Houston, Texas</p>
<p>The stacks and cooling towers of the ExxonMobil Baytown Refinery and Chemical Complex in Baytown, Texas, seem a world away from the quiet stacks and computer terminals of the University of Iowa Libraries. However, Sharon K. Tinker has found a world of opportunity in both places&#8212;which is why the 1980 UI graduate and longtime ExxonMobil employee now gives back to the UI Libraries.</p>
<p>&#8220;I support the UI Libraries because I want to return some of the good fortune that my college education and degree have provided for me&#8212;and because the Libraries system offers learning opportunities not only for UI students, faculty, and staff, but also for all Iowans,&#8221; says Sharon, who grew up on a farm near Manchester, Iowa.</p>
<p>This former Iowa farm girl is now the Unit Maintenance Department Manager of the Baytown Refinery, where she works with a team of engineers, machinists, electricians, instrument technicians, and supervisors to ensure that the plant meets its important maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Through The University of Iowa&#8212;and its libraries&#8212;Tinker was able to transform her high school passion for math and sciences into this successful career as a chemical engineer. And during her time as a student in the UI College of Engineering, Sharon says she spent countless hours in the UI&#8217;s various libraries, including the Main Library, the Engineering Library, the Math Library, and the Chemistry Library.</p>
<p>That explains why she&#8217;s chosen to invest so generously in the UI Libraries throughout the years since her Iowa graduation. Sharon makes frequent gifts to Friends of the Libraries and the Engineering Library Fund, and she also has contributed to the Louise Noun-Mary Louise Smith Iowa Women&#8217;s Archives, making her first gift in honor of her grandmother, Margaret Tinker.</p>
<p>&#8220;The UI Libraries system helps open up the world to inquiring minds,&#8221; Sharon says. &#8220;It provides amazing opportunities for the students and citizens who are willing to use its resources and make the effort to learn everything they can.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Sharon was busy learning as much as she could at the UI Libraries during her days on the Iowa campus, she also was enjoying her time as a student: &#8220;I enjoyed so much about the University. Like most college students, I enjoyed the independence of being away from home and making my own decisions. I also enjoyed my studies because of the challenges of learning the engineering concepts.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, Sharon says she chose The University of Iowa partly because it was actively recruiting female engineering students like her during the 1970s. This choice paid off, launching Sharon on her lengthy career with ExxonMobil in Houston&#8212;and even helping her travel to England and Singapore, where she lived during a four-year assignment for ExxonMobil in the mid-1990s.</p>
<p>The UI graduate has shown her appreciation for these professional experiences by not only contributing to the UI Libraries, but also to other areas&#8212;including the <a href="/engineering/">College of Engineering</a> and the <a href="/impact/">Iowa Impact Fund</a>&#8212;on campus. She is a member of <a href="/pc/">The Presidents Club</a>, which recognizes the University&#8217;s most generous contributors, and she also is the head of the UI Chemical Engineering Advisory Board.</p>
<p>Sharon&#8217;s &#8220;love for books&#8221; keeps the UI Libraries among her top giving priorities because she believes its resources provide so many benefits to so many different users. &#8220;Thanks to the variety of subject matter and media, there is something for everyone in a good library, if you&#8217;re willing to explore,&#8221; says Sharon.</p>
<p>And thanks to her vision and commitment, other UI students can follow in her footsteps, exploring the Libraries&#8217; resources&#8212;and discovering a world of opportunities. </p>

		<description><![CDATA["I've been fortunate to have many good opportunities in my life, thanks, in part, to my education at The University of Iowa."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/swords.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="swords" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Burlington, Iowa</p>
<p>When Bernard L. &#8220;Bernie&#8221; Swords of Burlington, Iowa, died in 2006, he left behind many friends with happy memories. He also left a philanthropic legacy that will resonate for generations at The University of Iowa: approximately $300,000 in estate gifts—on top of almost $100,000 given during his lifetime—to numerous UI areas.</p>
<p>Swords, a 1942 UI business graduate, picked the right year for a die-hard Iowa Hawkeye fan to begin his UI college experience: 1939, perhaps the most mythical and memorable year in Iowa football history.</p>
<p>That was the year Nile Kinnick won the Heisman Trophy and the &#8220;Ironmen,&#8221; as that Hawkeye squad was known, scored dramatic victories over Notre Dame and Minnesota. Swords knew Kinnick and became good friends with Mike Enich, a tackle on the team. He went on to hold season football tickets for more than 50 years.</p>
<p>That allegiance to the University didn&#8217;t stop with being a Hawkeye fan, however. Swords, a proud <a href="/pc/">Presidents Club</a> member, also gave to the UI Foundation for more than 40 years, for UI areas as diverse as the <a href="/business/">UI Henry B. Tippie College of Business</a>, where he established the Bernard L. Swords Scholarship; <a href="http://www.uifoundation.org/hancher/">Hancher Auditorium</a>; the <a href="http://www.givetoiowa.org/music">School of Music</a> in the <a href="http://www.uifoundation.org/liberal-arts/">College of Liberal Arts and Sciences</a>; <a href="http://www.uifoundation.org/libraries/">University Libraries</a>; and <a href="http://www.uifoundation.org/athletics/">men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s athletics</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, as a demonstration of both the breadth and depth of his commitment to the UI, Swords established a charitable bequest in his will benefiting all of these areas. Now, his dreams are being realized, as people throughout the UI benefit from his generosity. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.gftpln.org/stelterweb/CategoryDetailList.do?orgId=158&#038;categoryId=222">Charitable bequests</a> were an ideal way for Swords to establish his UI legacy. Because bequests are fully revocable, Swords could always rest assured that if his financial situation changed, his bequest could have as well.</p>
<p>By working with the <a href="http://www.uifoundation.org/contact/departments/index.shtml#planned-giving">UI Foundation planned giving staff</a>, Swords was able to help future generations of UI students receive the best possible education. That was important to Swords, because his UI experience was formative in his own life.</p>
<p>He was a student in the College of Commerce, as the Tippie College of Business was then called, and was an active member of his fraternity, Beta Theta Pi. He learned from such wonderful teachers as Chester A. Phillips, then the dean of the business school, and the campus social environment taught him valuable &#8220;people&#8221; skills.</p>
<p>Taken together, his UI experiences prepared him for a fulfilling life&#8212;one marked by extraordinary loyalty, both to his employer and his alma mater. After a stint in the Army, Swords worked as a traveling salesman for 40 years, selling wholesale furniture in Iowa and Nebraska for Chittenden &#038; Eastman Company of Burlington. &#8220;I liked it as much on the last day as on the first,&#8221; he said. He retired in 1987.</p>
<p>Swords&#8217;s explanation for his far-reaching charitable bequest to the UI was simple. &#8220;I appreciate the overall picture of the University,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m thinking of the future, of the students.&#8221; </p>
<p>That future is now here&#8212;and those students are benefiting from the Bernard L. Swords legacy at Iowa.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/liberal-arts1.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="liberal-arts1" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Austin, Texas</p>
<p>Carl Stuart (1969 B.A., political science) and Claire Field Stuart (1969 B.A., elementary education) met as students in the UI College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (CLAS).</p>
<p>The two were married after returning from Peru, where they spent six months after graduation teaching English 11,000 feet up in the Andes. After that, Carl says his career &#8220;followed a crooked line&#8221;&#8212;but it has undoubtedly been a line pointing upward.</p>
<p>He served in the National Guard and worked for his father-in-law&#8217;s clothing business in Waterloo before he and Claire moved to Austin, Texas, where he pursued a career in finance&#8212;a decision that proved to be satisfying and profitable.</p>
<p>Today, Carl owns a successful investment management company and for more than a decade has hosted &#8220;Money Talk,&#8221; a popular weekly call-in show on Austin&#8217;s KLBJ radio. In 2002, he was selected by <em>Registered Rep.</em> (the leading industry magazine) as one of the top 10 financial advisers in the country, and he also teaches courses in financial and investment planning at the University of Texas.</p>
<p>Claire took time off from teaching elementary school to raise their three children before earning a master&#8217;s degree in counseling from Texas State University.</p>
<p>She now works as a counselor specializing in the treatment of adolescents. &#8220;After I had messed up my own kids,&#8221; she jokes, &#8220;it was time to move on to someone else&#8217;s!&#8221; (Carl and Claire are very proud of all three, now grown.)</p>
<p>Both agree that their CLAS education helped them to be open to new possibilities and equipped them to excel, no matter what their professions. &#8220;The articulation and critical-thinking skills I learned at the UI always serve me well,&#8221; Carl says.</p>
<p>Claire adds, &#8220;My professors taught me how to ask important questions and helped me to open my mind to different ways of thinking&#8212;skills that have been instrumental in my work with children.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Stuarts have supported the UI and the college for decades with annual gifts. Recently, they increased their philanthropic commitment to the college by establishing the endowed Carl W. and Claire Field Stuart CLAS Excellence and Innovation Fund, which allows the dean to make awards to CLAS departments for creative new programs that will increase the college&#8217;s visibility, excellence, and reputation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like giving to your friends,&#8221; explains Carl of why he and Claire support the UI among other favorite philanthropic causes. &#8220;It all comes down to a fondness for the University. The four years we spent there were seminal in our lives, and our UI education gave us the confidence to seek adventure.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/strauss.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="strauss" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Iowa City, Iowa</p>
<p>It all started with a walloping snowstorm and a sturdy Saab, bravely forging a path from Boston to a new home on the Midwestern plains. </p>
<p>John S. Strauss journeyed to Iowa City through a howling blizzard to begin his new job as head of the University of Iowa Department of Dermatology. However, this icy arrival actually marked the beginning of a lasting and warm UI relationship for both Strauss, and his wife, Susan.</p>
<p>The longtime couple made their first gift for Iowa in 1979, which sparked a passion for giving that has spanned more than three decades and will end with a remainderman interest for the University. Now, the Strausses are among the University’s most generous contributors. They are Platinum members of the<br />
<a href="http://www.uifoundation.org/pc/">Presidents Club</a> and have contributed to areas as diverse as the <a href="http://www.uifoundation.org/medicine/">UI Roy J. and Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine</a>, including the UI Department of Dermatology and the Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center; <a href="http://www.uifoundation.org/hancher/">Hancher</a>; the School of Art and Art History; the Old Capitol Museum restoration project; WSUI and KSUI; <a href="http://www.uifoundation.org/carver/">Carver-Hawkeye Arena</a>; and the Ronald McDonald House.</p>
<p>In 2007, their interest in Hancher spearheaded the Joffrey Ballet’s statewide tour in celebration of Hancher’s 35th anniversary, and they made charitable gifts to help Hancher and the UI Museum of Art in the wake of the Flood of 2008. This year, they were major supporters of the Hubbard Street Dance Chicago’s free performance in Iowa City.</p>
<p>“It’s a pleasure to invest in these sorts of projects with a few extra dollars that can go wherever they’re needed most,” says Susan Strauss. This determination to help wherever they can has shaped the Strausses’ community involvement&#8212;and John Strauss’s work for the University. A graduate of Yale University, he was widely influential in the field of dermatology—and a source of inspiration for colleagues and students alike.</p>
<p>“I feel fortunate to have had the opportunities I did,” says John Strauss. “Being able to give back to the place that has given us so much is an honor.”</p>
<p>Though John Strauss retired in 2000, the couple currently are members of the Campaign Committee for <a href="http://www.uifoundation.org/iowafirst/"><em>Iowa First: Our Campaign for Breakthrough Medicine</em></a> and continue to support the UI through gifts of time and resources. </p>
<p>Together, the Strausses have helped ensure that their Midwestern community&#8212;and its remarkable University&#8212;remain as warm and welcoming as ever.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/stephens.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="stephens" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Iowa City, Iowa</p>
<p>Ralph and Barbara (1985 B.F.A.) Stephens came to The University of Iowa in 1965 when Ralph was hired as an assistant professor in the College of Engineering. </p>
<p>During his 46 years at the UI, Ralph&#8217;s teaching and research work in mechanical systems, materials fatigue, and fracture mechanics kept life busy, but interesting. &#8220;In all my years here, I&#8217;ve never felt like I needed a break—except when I was writing,&#8221; laughs Ralph. He&#8217;s also thoroughly enjoyed his interactions with students both in the classroom and in the lab.</p>
<p>The couple has three children: Susan; Robert, who earned a mechanical engineering degree from the UI in 1985; and Kristen, and as they grew, Barb found time to enroll in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. She earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in art and art history, graduating alongside son Robert in 1985. </p>
<p>In 1988, Ralph was on campus outside Danforth Chapel before his daughter&#8217;s wedding when he had a sudden realization: The University of Iowa and the state of Iowa had become his true home. &#8220;I looked around campus and thought about what a great experience I&#8217;d had so far,&#8221; says Ralph. &#8220;Barb and I realized how much we loved the UI, my colleagues, and what an incredible journey we&#8217;d made.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not long after that, we started thinking about making a bequest to the UI,&#8221; says Barb.</p>
<p>Fast forward to present day, and Ralph is in phased retirement—though he still keeps close tabs on the college, teaching two classes in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering each fall. The couple also have seven grandchildren to keep up with. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Barb and Ralph had been thinking about their planned gifts to the UI, and had another important realization: they wanted to give now. &#8220;We saw an immediate need within my department,&#8221; says Ralph. &#8220;And now we&#8217;ll be able to see the difference we&#8217;ve made.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ultimately, the couple made two contributions to The University of Iowa Foundation. The first was an outright gift of $250,000 to support the Professor Ralph and Barbara Stephens Experimental Engineering Lab, to be housed in the Seamans Center for the Engineering Arts and Sciences. The gift has already contributed to a new class offering, and funds will be used to equip the lab, support a temporary student lab position, and endow annual funding. </p>
<p>The second gift will establish the Professor Ralph I. and Barbara G. Stephens Women’s Basketball Scholarship. The couple gave $50,000 to start the fund, and the remaining $150,000 will come to the UI Foundation through a bequest in their estate plans. Ralph and Barb are avid Hawkeye fans and started following the UI women more closely after Barb began volunteering at Game Time, a summer women&#8217;s basketball league in North Liberty. &#8220;I think the girls are a lot of fun to watch,&#8221; says Barb. &#8220;They really work together, and we&#8217;re happy to support the UI team.&#8221;</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time the couple have included the UI in their planned giving. Several years ago, they established a $100,000 scholarship for the School of Art and Art History in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Barbara&#8217;s alma mater. They also created an additional $250,000 scholarship fund for the College of Engineering. </p>
<p>&#8220;We feel good about this, and so proud,&#8221; says Barb.</p>
<p>Ralph agrees. &#8220;My greatest accomplishments were gained at Iowa,&#8221; he says. &#8220;This is a great way to give back to our wonderful University, and I hope other faculty will consider doing the same.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/athletics1.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="athletics" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Marion, Iowa</p>
<p>Peg and John Slusher stepped up to the plate and made history as the first contributors to fully endow a named scholarship for a specific position in Hawkeye women&#8217;s athletics.</p>
<p>The <strong>Peg and John Slusher Softball Catcher&#8217;s Scholarship</strong> pays tuition and fees, room, and board for the starting catcher on the UI softball squad.</p>
<p>The Slushers are both retired employees of Rockwell Collins and live in Marion. They started attending Iowa sporting events in 1981 and quickly caught the Hawkeye fever.</p>
<p>In a sign of the extent of their devotion to the Hawkeyes, in one whirlwind weekend they once attended the national NCAA wrestling tournament in Oklahoma City, leaving after the last match on Saturday night and making it back to Iowa in time to catch the Hawkeye women&#8217;s basketball team play in an early round of the NCAA tournament.</p>
<p>For these devoted Hawkeye fans, endowing the Slusher Scholarship was an opportunity to help advance the softball team&#8217;s pursuit of excellence, both athletically and academically.</p>
<p>&#8220;The softball team is so exciting to watch,&#8221; Peg says. &#8220;We chose to endow the scholarship for the catcher because we felt it was one of the most difficult and demanding positions on the team.&#8221; </p>
<p>Thanks to the Slushers&#8217; loyalty to the Hawkeyes and concern for student-athletes, generations of talented catchers will wear the black and gold as they strive for success in competition, in the classroom, and in their careers.<br />

		<description><![CDATA["My support for Hancher is selfish&#8212;I don't ever want their excellent programming to change."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/hancher1.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="hancher1" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Iowa City, Iowa</p>
<p>Peggy Scholz moved to Iowa City from Evanston, Illinois, in 1967 and made her first gift to Hancher in 1984. Having worked for 21 years as a systems analyst in the UI Roy J. And Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine and in University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, she has a deep affinity for the town, the University, and especially Hancher. </p>
<p>&#8220;Hancher supports an unusually large number of world premieres,&#8221; she says. &#8220;It&#8217;s exciting to see a performance in New York or San Francisco and discover it premiered in Iowa City.&#8221; She adds, &#8220;I also really like the staff. The administration, the development staff, and the Hancher Guild members are warm and genuine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the years, Peggy has contributed to the Hancher Circle Fund and special funds such as the OVATION! and Millennium Campaigns.</p>
<p>In 2001, she made a contribution to support the commission of a piece by the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company. &#8220;I respect Bill T. Jones as an artist, and I&#8217;m always excited to see what he will create next.&#8221; </p>
<p>Peggy also contributes time and energy to the Hancher Guild, a group of volunteers that provides services, including running the Hancher Guild showcase in the lobby and arranging post-performance parties for artists.</p>
<p>&#8220;All of the profits from showcase sales go toward Hancher&#8217;s arts education programs,&#8221; says Peggy, who is the Guild&#8217;s president. &#8220;In 2001 we raised $35,000!</p>
<p>&#8220;I support Hancher because it is a tremendous asset to the state of Iowa,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;Not only does it bring us great artists, but the arts-education programs give Iowa children an exposure to the arts that many kids even in large cities don&#8217;t get.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="720" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/just-schnoor1.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="just-schnoor" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Iowa City, Iowa</p>
<div style="float:right;padding-left:10px;width:240px;"><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="240" height="141" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/c4KvpOBFYWw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Last July, when UI College of Engineering professor Jerry Schnoor won the prestigious Clarke Prize, a national award recognizing significant contributions to the area of water research and technology, he traveled to California to accept his $50,000 award and medallion, and give a lecture. He decided to incorporate into his speech information on Iowa engineering students and the work they were doing with his colleague Craig Just through the UI chapters of <a href="http://www.uiewb.org/">Engineers Without Borders USA</a> and <a href="http://www.uiesw.org/">Engineers for a Sustainable World</a>. </p>
<p>&#8220;By the time I finished writing the speech, I realized I wanted to give the money to the students,&#8221; says Jerry. </p>
<p>When Craig Just, adjunct associate professor in the UI Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and advisor for the student groups, heard the news about his colleague’s gift, he was grateful. He also was inspired to make a gift of his own. </p>
<p>&#8220;In a way, this gift was 18 years in the making,&#8221; says Craig, who has worked in some capacity at The University of Iowa since 1993. &#8220;But I also was very touched by Jerry&#8217;s generosity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Craig and his wife, Tracy, who is a hygienist in the College of Dentistry, soon matched Jerry’s gift. </p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t intended to be a challenge,” laughed Jerry. &#8220;But I&#8217;m so pleased that they gave, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>UI students will surely be thankful as well. The $100,000 boost to the Engineers for a Sustainable World Fund will enable more students to participate in service-learning trips to Kobriti, a small village in Ghana, to which the UI Engineers Without Borders USA chapter has recently made a five-year commitment. </p>
<p>&#8220;In Ghana, students will have the opportunity to work on water sanitation, solar energy, and other basic infrastructure projects that will benefit the people of Kobriti,&#8221; says Craig. He also noted that it is not only Engineering students who will have the opportunity to travel. In the past, students in business, international studies, and other UI areas have made the trip.</p>
<p>&#8220;A medical student accompanied us on our last trip,&#8221; says Craig. &#8220;To see a poor, remote hospital, as compared to a resource-rich facility in the U.S.—that had a profound effect on her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Craig has been leading the trips to Ghana. For each trip, the team goes for a period of five weeks, taking four to six students. &#8220;The first thing we do when we go to one of these villages is listen,&#8221; says Jerry, who hasn&#8217;t yet been to Ghana, but has conducted similar assessment trips in Mexico and Haiti. &#8220;Often the people there know exactly what they need,&#8221; says Craig. &#8220;They just don&#8217;t have the resources to make the necessary improvements.&#8221;</p>
<p>The group has been assessing the village&#8217;s needs, conducting health and resource surveys, and will implement technology and processes to improve living conditions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now there is so much need,&#8221; says Jerry. &#8220;And we have so many students who are willing to go and help. More funding means more students can go, and more good can be done.&#8221; </p>
<p>Thanks in part to the generosity of these remarkable professors, UI students are solving real-world problems. &#8220;And that,&#8221; says Craig, &#8220;is what engineers do.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/sayre.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="sayre" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Iowa City, Iowa</p>
<p>Robert F. Sayre fell in love with rowing &#8212; and water &#8212; during his family&#8217;s summer vacations at New York&#8217;s Great South Bay in the 1940s. There, his mother taught him to row dinghies and skiffs, sparking a lifelong passion that still burns today. It is this passion that has prompted Sayre &#8212; together with his wife, Hutha (1963 B.S.N.) &#8212; to invest in the new <a href="http://www.uifoundation.org/boathouse/">University of Iowa P. Sue Beckwith, M.D., Boathouse</a>. </p>
<p>&quot;Hutha and I just love the sight of sleek shells and beautifully coordinated teams skimming over the Iowa River,&quot; says Robert Sayre, who joined the Hawkeye Rowing Club in 1990. &quot;We hope that, in addition to providing wonderful training and exercise for UI women rowers and local rowers, the Beckwith Boathouse also will draw more attention to the Iowa River.&quot;</p>
<p>The Sayres both have spent enough time in Iowa City to develop a deep appreciation for the Iowa River and its beautiful surroundings. Robert Sayre, a native of Columbus, Ohio, arrived on the UI campus in 1965, after graduating from Wesleyan University in 1955 and completing a Ph.D. in English at Yale University in 1962. He began at Iowa as an assistant professor in the Department of English and remained on the faculty as a professor and leading authority on American autobiographical writing, until his retirement in 1998.</p>
<p>Hutha Sayre grew up on a farm in Clayton County, Iowa, and returned to Iowa City in 1967 with her first husband, Tony Colby, who attended the Writers&#8217; Workshop. She married Robert Sayre in 1988, and together, they have five children from their previous marriages. The Sayres have traveled extensively throughout the state, conducting research for their two Iowa travel books, <em>Take This Exit</em>: <em>Rediscovering the Iowa Landscape</em> and <em>Take the Next Exit: New Views of the Iowa Landscape</em>.</p>
<p>Their love for Iowa and its environment is part of what prompted the couple &#8212; who are members of The Presidents Club, which recognizes the University&#8217;s most generous contributors &#8212; to support such an important resource for the University, the community, and the river. The two hope that their gift of $25,000, which will name a boat in Hutha&#8217;s honor, will inspire others to invest in the Iowa River, too. </p>
<p>&quot;We really hope that the more people use and enjoy the river, the more they will want to see it clear and clean,&quot; says Robert Sayre. </p>
<p>Thanks to their vision and generosity, Robert and Hutha Sayre have helped ensure that the beauty of the river &#8212; and the joy and grace of boats in motion on the water &#8212; will endure. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/rydson.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="rydson" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Elkhart, Indiana and Marco Island, Florida</p>
<p>Laura and Marlyn “Marly” Rydson of Elkhart, Indiana, and Marco Island, Florida, are longtime friends of The University of Iowa who love good books, good jazz, and good theatre.  </p>
<p>When the couple was invited to tour the UI campus a few years ago, they knew they wanted the Writers’ Workshop on their itinerary. They also knew they were contemplating a gift to the University, and as they listened to the late Writers’ Workshop director Frank Conroy and faculty member Canin (1984 M.F.A.) talk about the program, the couple knew that they’d found the UI area they most wanted to support. </p>
<p>The two avid readers were especially excited to meet Canin, as they were fans of his book, <em>The Palace Thief</em>, and the popular film based on it, <em>The Emperor’s Club</em>.  </p>
<p>“Laura reads three or four books a week and often buys books published by the University of Iowa Press,” said Marly Rydson.  “We knew this was where we wanted to invest in the University’s future.”</p>
<p>The Writers’ Workshop in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences was the first creative writing degree program in the country when it was established in 1936, and it regularly ranks number one in <em>U.S.News &amp; World Report</em>’s college rankings.</p>
<p>That’s why the couple was so excited to establish the Marly and Laura Rydson Faculty Fellowship—the first endowed faculty award ever created in the Writers’ Workshop—in 2002.  They were especially pleased when Canin became the fellowship’s first recipient.</p>
<p>Since then, the Rydsons also have made another major gift commitment in support of the recently completed addition to the Dey House, where the Workshop is housed.</p>
<p>“We’re so grateful for alumni and friends like the Rydsons who take real pride and pleasure in what our students create,” Canin says. </p>
<p>He demonstrated his gratitude for their generosity by autographing a poster for <em>The Emperor’s Club</em>, which hangs prominently in the Rydson  home. It reads, “For Marly and Laura—Emperors in Deed.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/roth.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="roth" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Leesburg, Virginia</p>
<p>It was 1943 when a handsome Air Force lieutenant walked into a party and was swept off his feet by a young University of Iowa nurse. She had just come from surgery with Drs. Arthur Steindler and Ignacio Ponseti, and the lieutenant would later joke that, because of the ether still lingering on her, he awoke the next day to discover they were engaged.</p>
<p>On that heady evening, Bernice “Bunny” M. Weede Havlicek (1940 G.N.) and Frank J. Havlicek (1948 B.S.P.E.) did not yet know that their chance encounter would one day help future generations of UI students.</p>
<p>However, thanks to a generous investment to endow the Bernice M. Weede and Frank J. Havlicek Scholarship in the UI College of Nursing, the Havliceks’ longstanding love for one another—and for The University of Iowa—will live on through the students who receive their gifts.</p>
<p>Though Frank died in 2003, at age 85, Jane Roth—the couple’s only child—made this commitment in tribute to her parents and to their abiding affection for The University of Iowa.</p>
<p>“I didn’t graduate from the UI, but my Iowa roots remain strong,” says Roth, who is director of administration for Datatel, Inc., in Fairfax, Virginia. “The University is the core of those roots; it gives young people the chance to reach their dreams.”</p>
<p>This was very true for Roth’s mother, who worked at a clothing store in Bloomfield, Iowa, during high school so that she could fulfill her childhood dream of becoming a nurse at The University of Iowa. Roth’s father also found his sense of purpose at Iowa, arriving as a director of physical training in the Air Force and eventually holding positions as a UI instructor in physical education, an assistant UI swim coach, and business manager for the UI Department of Athletics.</p>
<p>Frank, who came up with the idea for a UI mascot—which Dick Spencer sketched and which later received the name “Herky” through a state-wide naming contest—would be proud to know that his family was helping his alma mater.</p>
<p>“Education was important to both of my parents,” says Roth, who was inspired to increase the initial amount of her gift—from 80 to 100 percent of her estate—after attending a Women in Philanthropy event with UI President Sally Mason. “There are quiet ways to help people, and we just would like to give others the chance to succeed. There is such a critical shortage of nurses right now, and we want to make a difference with our gift.”</p>
<p>Thanks to this generous vision, a new generation of UI nursing students can face their futures the same way the Havliceks did—with a sense of gratitude and possibility.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/dentistry.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="College of Dentistry" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Iowa City, Iowa</p>
<p>Iowa natives Jackson and Nona Seberg Roe met at the University in the 1940s, when she had completed a degree in Communication and Theatre Arts and was working as social director at the student union, and he was studying dentistry.</p>
<p>Today, after more than 55 years of marriage, they still have a &#8220;soft spot for supporting education at The University of Iowa.&#8221; </p>
<p>For many years, most of them spent in California, the Roes maintained their passion for the UI. Their support reflects their broad range of interests, with gifts to the Hancher Circle Fund, the Hawkeye men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s athletics programs, and the UI Alumni Association.</p>
<p>When the couple moved back to Iowa City in 1999, they did more than re-commit to their home state. They worked with Dave Triplett of the UI Foundation gift planning department and other Foundation staff to develop a personalized giving strategy that met their personal needs and philanthropic priorities, while helping the UI maximize its opportunities.</p>
<p>Their gifts to establish the Jackson H. and Nona Seberg Roe Professorship in Orthodontics, and the Jackson H. and Nona Seberg Roe Faculty Fellowship in the Special Care Clinic, both in the College of Dentistry, reveal a firm commitment to the UI.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maintaining an excellent faculty is not easy to do,&#8221; says Jackson. &#8220;We wanted to help ensure the excellence of the Iowa program will continue.</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter where you go, the UI College of Dentistry is considered one of the best. When I started my orthodontic practice in California, people recognized and respected my Iowa degree,&#8221; Jackson says. &#8220;We moved back to Iowa because it&#8217;s where we got our start. And we&#8217;re giving back to the University so others will get the same great start we had.&#8221;</p>

		<description><![CDATA["The nobility of effort and the dedication that these student-athletes exhibit in their work inspired me to do my part."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/railsback.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="railsback" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Des Moines, Iowa</p>
<p>Linda D. Railsback (1974 M.D., 1978 R.) doesn&#8217;t do anything halfway. Whether she&#8217;s working for Doctors of the World in a developing country or contributing to her alma mater, the Phillips, Texas, native gives of herself wholeheartedly. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s no surprise, then, that Railsback made&#8212;for two years in a row&#8212;the largest-ever online gifts in the history of The University of Iowa Foundation for the new <strong><a href="http://www.uifoundation.org/boathouse/" class="highlightCopy">P. Sue Beckwith, M.D., Boathouse</a></strong>.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been my privilege to make these gifts. I can, and therefore, I should&#8212;and it absolutely needed to be done,&#8221; says Railsback. &#8220;It&#8217;s not acceptable to have such inadequate facilities for the University&#8217;s second-largest athletic team.&#8221;</p>
<p>This passion on behalf of the Iowa women&#8217;s rowing team, as well as a connection with P. Sue Beckwith (1980 B.S., 1984 M.D.)&#8212;who made a naming gift of $1 million for the boathouse, and whom Railsback knows personally and professionally&#8212;is what inspired Railsback to make a total gift of $90,000 for the project in 2008, in honor of the team&#8217;s nine graduating seniors, and a contribution of $80,000 in 2009 for the team&#8217;s eight graduating seniors.</p>
<p>Though the new <a href="htt[://www.uifoundation.org/pc/" class="highlightCopy"><strong>Presidents Club</strong></a> member has been contributing to various UI initiatives since 1979, Railsback says that this investment was different: &#8220;These gifts represented the first time that I felt truly connected to my alma mater. I&#8217;m not sure why it&#8217;s different; I just know that I feel connected in a way I never did before.&#8221;</p>
<p>Railsback has devoted her life to connecting with others through medicine. By the age of six, she knew she wanted to be a doctor. Through hard work and dedication, she brought that dream to life, in spite of the many challenges facing women entering the male-dominated world of medicine in the 1970s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the negative experiences I had during that time made medical school a struggle for me,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Those memories have fueled my desire to continue working on behalf of women, whether I&#8217;m treating their medical needs or making a financial contribution.&#8221;</p>
<p>After completing her UI residency in obstetrics and gynecology, Railsback spent years in private practice in Des Moines, until &#8220;reconfiguring&#8221; her life in 1993 and retiring from her practice to work with a variety of humanitarian organizations, including Doctors of the World. She now spends several months of each year traveling with different aid groups to places such as Kosovo, Panama, and Cameroon. </p>
<p>&#8220;We provide education, equipment, and information. We do what we can, but it&#8217;s not always enough. In just one night in Kosovo in 1997, we lost six premature babies because there was no oxygen for the incubators. We deal with things that just rip your heart out,&#8221; Railsback says.</p>
<p>Though she spends months away from home, Railsback also invests in her local community. She works with underserved populations in the Des Moines area and runs four different projects for Planned Parenthood&#8212;and her generous UI giving is an extension of this community-minded commitment. </p>
<p>&#8220;I just feel like the boathouse project is such an important initiative. The nobility of effort and the dedication that these student-athletes exhibit in their work, both on and off the water, inspired me to do my part.&#8221; And without a doubt, this same level of purpose and dedication defines Linda Railsback&#8217;s good works as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/law1.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="College of Law1" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Minneapolis, Minnesota</p>
<p>John R. Wicks (1959 B.S.C., 1964 J.D.) first became a Hawkeye fan growing up in Iowa City. Receiving degrees in accounting and law solidified his commitment to the University of Iowa and paved the way for a successful 40-year career with the Minneapolis-based law firm of Dorsey &#038; Whitney, LLP.</p>
<p>Both John and his wife, Nedra Morgan Wicks (1962 B.A.), have maintained ties to and support for the university since their respective graduations. John served on the Iowa Law School Foundation board for more than a decade, including a term as president, during which time he “met and worked with many talented graduates of the law school, all of whom were there because they wanted to give back to the school.” Nedra’s late father, Professor Philip F. Morgan, is honored in the UI College of Engineering’s Hall of Fame, and a scholarship continues to be awarded in his name. Their son, John F. Wicks, graduated from the University of Iowa in 1998 with Master’s of Business Administration and Juris Doctorate degrees.</p>
<p>Wicks spent his career as an estate planning attorney, and in reviewing his own estate plan in 2012 he decided the time had come to establish a charitable gift annuity (CGA) which would benefit both him and the Iowa Law School. Wicks gave high marks to the UI Foundation for the support they provided in completing the arrangements.</p>
<p>“Not only was the staff at the foundation knowledgeable in helping with computations and the preparation of documents, but the agreement is just two pages long and completely understandable. There are other vehicles for deferred gifts in more complex situations, but in our case, simpler was better,” Wicks said. </p>
<p>Giving via a CGA allows for a substantial income tax deduction and an annual stream of income, the annual payout being determined based on the age of the donor at the time the gift is made.</p>
<p>John and Nedra feel strongly about the importance of quality educational opportunities and are pleased that they can help repay some of the support that was once provided for them.</p>

		<description><![CDATA["It is important that students develop a conscience in business."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/prappas.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="prappas" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Houston, Texas</p>
<p>Mary T. and Dempsey J. Prappas have established their educational legacy by creating two permanently endowed faculty chairs at The University of Iowa.</p>
<p>The Mary Thomas Prappas Chair in Business Ethics will support the teaching and research of a faculty member in the UI Henry B. Tippie College of Business who specializes in business ethics. The Dempsey J. Prappas Chair in Constitutional Law will similarly support a constitutional law expert on the UI College of Law faculty. The gift commitments establishing the Prappas Chairs were made through bequests to the University of Iowa Foundation and the Iowa Law School Foundation.</p>
<p>The Prappases&#8217; parents were Greek immigrants who came to this country with very little formal education and limited financial resources, and who encouraged their children to receive a college education. Mary Thomas Prappas is a native of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and a 1949 UI business graduate. She taught at the college and elementary school levels in California, Illinois and Houston for several years, and has been active in the Greek Orthodox Church and arts organizations in Houston.</p>
<p>Explaining her motivation for establishing the chair that is named for her, Mary Prappas cited her interest in promoting ethical practices among future business leaders.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is important that students develop a conscience in business,&#8221; Mary Prappas said. &#8220;They need to be aware of ethics and of the consequences of unethical behavior on others&#8217; lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dean William C. &#8220;Curt&#8221; Hunter of the UI Tippie College of Business said the chair will be an important part of the college&#8217;s future.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the Mary Thomas Prappas Chair, the UI Tippie College of Business will be able to strengthen its position as a leader in the field of business ethics, and will be able to attract nationally prominent faculty,&#8221; Hunter said. &#8220;We are extremely grateful for the Prappases&#8217; generosity and commitment to our students&#8217; futures. Alumni like Mrs. Prappas are crucial partners for our college.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dempsey Prappas is a Michigan native who earned a B.A. degree in political science from the University of Michigan in 1949 and a J.D. degree from the University of Texas in 1953. He is a World War II veteran, whose infantry division landed at Utah Beach. On September 13, 1944, he was critically wounded in Alsace Lorraine and was awarded the Purple Heart and Bronze Star. He started the pursuit of his college education in September 1945 and went on to a distinguished law career.</p>
<p>He was managing senior partner of his own law firm for 25 years before becoming vice president and general counsel for Texas Olefins Company and, simultaneously, of counsel at the Houston law firm of Butler Binion.</p>
<p>Dempsey Prappas said his deep respect for the U.S. Constitution inspired him to establish the Dempsey J. Prappas Chair in Constitutional Law.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Constitution is the cornerstone of our nation,&#8221; Dempsey Prappas said. &#8220;It&#8217;s wonderful to know that there will be lawyers from the Iowa Law School standing up for our Constitution who were inspired by a professor who holds a chair in my name.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dean Carolyn Jones of the UI College of Law said the chair will bolster the UI&#8217;s reputation as a leader in constitutional law.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks to Dempsey and Mary Prappas&#8217;s generosity, generations of UI law students will receive a world-class education in constitutional law here at Iowa,&#8221; Jones said. &#8220;We are delighted that Mr. Prappas chose the UI for establishing such a vital legacy.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/athletics1.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="athletics" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Coon Rapids, Iowa</p>
<p>When Dan Pomeroy was a UI student, he became a major Hawkeye fan. His work in student government helping with the planning for the Carver-Hawkeye Arena project deepened the attachment.</p>
<p>By the time Pomeroy graduated in 1981 with a B.S. degree from the College of Pharmacy, his love for the Hawkeyes had become a passion that will last a lifetime. In fact, he has long been active in the I-Club, including as a member of the organization&#8217;s national board of directors.</p>
<p>Pomeroy drives three hours each way for home football and basketball games from his home in Coon Rapids, Iowa, where he owns and operates the Coon Rapids Pharmacy, and he has attended almost every UI bowl game. The tailgate parties that he and his friends have before UI home football games are a high point of each year for him, a time of coming together in support of the black and gold.</p>
<p>For Pomeroy, being a Hawkeye fan is a way of life. And he&#8217;s quick to point out that his responsibility as an Iowa supporter goes beyond buying tickets and cheering until the walls and rafters ring. Pomeroy believes that a loyal Hawkeye fan needs to show financial support as well, and he&#8217;s answered the call by contributing to the I-Club for almost 20 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no way fans can support an athletics program just on ticket sales. Scholarships and other necessities are so expensive—and so important. By giving to the I-Club and special campaigns, I feel invested in the program, like I&#8217;m a part of it,&#8221; Pomeroy says.</p>
<p>Summing up his heartfelt generosity, this diehard Hawkeye fan says, &#8220;The UI gave me an invaluable experience as a student and I have a great career because of it. Now I have a responsibility to give back.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/petersen.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="petersen" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Harlan, Iowa</p>
<p>As a UI student, Mary Louise Petersen (1951 B.A.) was in charge of a women&#8217;s group that organized lectures in Old Capitol Museum&#8217;s Senate Chamber. The sound of the bell summoning her to class still rings in her ears.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what prompted Mary Louise (1951 B.A.) and her husband, Rand (1951 B.A.), of Harlan, Iowa, to provide generous support for Pentacrest Museums in the form of a bequest gift committing $500,000 to the Old Capitol Museum Campaign—part of a $1 million gift that also includes support for the UI Museum of Natural History.</p>
<p>For Mary Louise—who was co-chair of the UI&#8217;s successful $1 billion comprehensive campaign, which ended on December 31, 2005, and who also co-chaired the Old Capitol Museum campaign committee—<strong>support for the Pentacrest Museums is a matter of personal history and civic pride</strong>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Old Capitol Museum is important to me, to the University, and to the state,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We have an opportunity to create an even better experience for everyone, from residents throughout Iowa and the region to UI students and faculty who will have a new platform for research and for presenting their work.&#8221;</p>
<p>On July 4, 1976, our nation&#8217;s bicentennial, Mary Louise was chair of the Board of Regents, State of Iowa, and helped preside over the ceremony reopening Old Capitol as a museum and marking its dedication as a National Register of Historic Places landmark. That was after an earlier historical renovation of Old Capitol, which, like the most recent renovation, also was made possible, in large part, by private support.</p>
<p>Mary Louise is fascinated by Old Capitol&#8217;s history as the first territorial and state capitol, the place where Iowa—and The University of Iowa—began. And she was excited to help Old Capitol Museum enter its next chapter of service.</p>

		<description><![CDATA["The most important thing we can do here at the UI is to empower bright young people who will go out and solve problems."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/parkin.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="parkin" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Iowa City, Iowa</p>
<p>Gene Parkin&#8217;s primary research interest as a University of Iowa professor of civil and environmental engineering is in using microbial processes to degrade pollutants.</p>
<p>But the most essential biological products he&#8217;s helping to develop are not microscopic organisms—they&#8217;re the students who will carry their UI education into the field as engineering teachers, researchers, and professionals.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most important thing we can do here at the UI is to <strong>empower bright young people who will go out and solve problems</strong>,&#8221; Parkin said. &#8220;And that&#8217;s what being the Donald E. Bently Professor of Engineering allows me to do. It enables me to attract to our college excellent students who are curious about how things work and why, and who are eager to explore interesting ideas. The professorship funds those students&#8217; work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Parkin&#8217;s interest in students&#8217; development extends beyond his role as a research mentor and classroom teacher, however—he made a significant financial contribution to the campaign to build the state-of-the-art Seamans Center for the Engineering Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p>The Seamans Center is instrumental to the college&#8217;s efforts to recruit and retain top students and enables those students to pursue innovative work in an optimal learning environment.</p>
<p>Parkin—himself a UI graduate, having earned a B.S. degree in civil engineering in 1970 and an M.S. degree in environmental engineering in 1971—is grateful for the opportunity to help students advance research intitiatives.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s also thankful for private support like that from Donald Bently (1949 B.S.E.E.; 1950 M.S.) and has been <strong>eager to join the cycle of giving that helps the College of Engineering</strong>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Bently Professorship provides freedom and continuity to our research-freedom to explore ideas that might lead somewhere but that aren&#8217;t developed enough to attract grant funding, and continuity to maintain activity between grants,&#8221; Parkin pointed out. &#8220;It&#8217;s a crucial resource for the college, and for the students whose work we&#8217;re able to fund.&#8221;</p>
<p>Likewise, Parkin&#8217;s support for the Seamans Center for Engineering Arts and Sciences and other college endeavors provides more freedom for the college to enhance its reputation as a place where students become <strong>engineers . . . and something more</strong>.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[“Those who stand to gain the most from the institute’s performance will be generations of patients nationwide and around the world.” - John Pappajohn]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/pappajohn.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="pappajohn" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Harlan, Iowa</p>
<p>John (1952 B.S.C.) and Mary Pappajohn made a $26.4 million gift commitment—the largest single gift commitment ever for the UI from individual Iowa donors—that will provide the University’s new interdisciplinary biomedical research institute with the catalyst it needs to reach its full potential.</p>
<p>The Pappajohns’ gift advances Iowa’s ability to explore high-risk, high-reward, interdisciplinary research opportunities in the life sciences. The Des Moines couple envisions the new <strong>Pappajohn Biomedical Institute</strong> in the <strong>John and Mary Pappajohn Biomedical Discovery Building</strong> as allowing top scientists from all corners of the UI campus to collaborate in the “super quest” for a healthier society.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, what everybody is looking for is a pill that would assist in ensuring total good health,” says John Pappajohn. “That’s a long way off, but for now, we just work with existing technology to improve health care as much as possible.”</p>
<p>Pappajohn was just 16 years old when his Greek immigrant father died, leaving his sons to run the family grocery store in Mason City, Iowa. Pappajohn and his brothers put themselves through college by taking turns running the store and attending The University of Iowa— which is where the visionary philanthropist honed his business acumen and his civic commitment.</p>
<p>After graduating in 1952 with a bachelor’s degree in business, Pappajohn went on to become a successful Iowa venture capitalist. He and Mary Pappajohn— who received her bachelor’s degree in related art from the University of Minnesota and serves as a trustee of both the Des Moines Art Center and the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis—are among the University of Iowa’s most generous supporters. Among their many significant UI contributions include naming gifts for the Pappajohn Business Building, the Pappajohn Pavilion at UI Hospitals and Clinics, the John and Mary Pappajohn Clinical Cancer Center, and the John Pappajohn Entrepreneurial Center.</p>
<p>“Mary and I are especially inspired by the institute’s collaborative, entrepreneurial, and university-wide dimensions,” John Pappajohn said, referring to the new institute bearing their names. “It’s our conviction that the prospects for strong returns on philanthropic investment in this institute are excellent. And those who stand to gain the most from the institute’s performance will be generations of patients nationwide and around the world.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="270" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/olmsted.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="olmsted" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Iowa City, Iowa</p>
<p>University of Iowa College of Dentistry graduate John Olmsted and his wife, Frankie, of Greensboro, North Carolina, have committed $100,000 to support the college.</p>
<p>In recognition of the Olmsteds’ generosity, the UI will establish the Olmsted Family Endodontic Faculty Suite in a new addition to the Dental Science Building.</p>
<p>&#8220;This building project represents a pivotal moment in the history of our college,&#8221; said David Johnsen, dean of the UI College of Dentistry. &#8220;Thanks to generous gifts from loyal alumni and friends like John and Frankie Olmsted, we can invest in the future of our college, and in Iowans’ improved oral health.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Frankie and I are honored to make this gift in support of such an important project,&#8221; John Olmsted said. &#8220;We know our investment will help the college not only retain leading researchers and scholars, but also recruit new research faculty by offering adequate and appropriately equipped space.&#8221;</p>
<p>John Olmsted completed two of his academic degrees at the UI, receiving his B.S. degree in 1972 and his D.D.S. degree in 1975. He completed his M.S. degree in endodontics at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill in 1977. Frankie Olmsted served as a dental lab technician at the UI College of Dentistry from 1972 to 1976. John Olmsted continues to be a leader in dentistry and is a past chairperson of the American Dental Association Annual Meeting and past president of the American Association of Endodontists.</p>
<p>John and Frankie Olmsted are members of the University of Iowa Presidents Club, which recognizes the University’s most generous contributors.</p>
<p>The Olmsteds’ son, Matthew, is a third-year orthodontic graduate student and resident in the College of Dentistry at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, and their daughter, Courtney, is a fourth-year medical student in the Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University.</p>
<p>The UI acknowledges the UI Foundation as the preferred channel for private contributions that benefit all areas of the university. For more information about the UI Foundation, visit its web site at <a href="http://www.uifoundation.org/">http://www.uifoundation.org/.</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/ohara-engeldinger.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="ohara-engeldinger" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Iowa City, Iowa</p>
<p>Longtime University of Iowa faculty members Michael O’Hara and Jane Engeldinger (1976 M.D.) have found a professional home at the UI. Jane completed her residency in obstetrics and gynecology at the UI in 1980, and has been with the University ever since. A practicing physician with UI Health Care, Jane also is a clinical professor in the UI Roy J. and Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine. Mike joined the faculty in 1980 and is a professor of psychology in the UI College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p>“The University is a diverse place that serves its employees, the community, and the state and beyond in many important ways,” says Mike. “We feel fortunate to be a part of it.”</p>
<p>The couple has marked their appreciation for the UI by <strong>establishing a charitable bequest in their estate plans</strong>. Part of their gift will create a professorship in the Department of Psychology in the UI College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. The couple also directed support to Hancher, an organization they’re particularly fond of.</p>
<p>“We both have a strong sense of responsibility to the programs and organizations that we value when it comes to charitable giving,” says Jane. “Hancher has enriched our lives and the lives of Iowans through its presentations and outreach activities, and we enjoy attending their productions. Similarly, the Psychology Department has done so much for Mike, and we both recognize how important professorships can be in sustaining excellence in academic departments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Through their generous gift, Jane and Mike will provide support for generations of future students, faculty, and community members, and they’re hopeful others will do the same.</p>
<p>“We’re delighted to be able to directly support the programs we value, but we also hope we will inspire others—particularly faculty members—to consider charitable bequests of their own to the University,” says Mike. “We also believe that the Foundation has been a good steward of its resources, and donors can have confidence that their charitable gifts will be used well and according to their wishes.”</p>
<p>Adds Jane, “Ultimately, these gifts will allow us to continue to have an impact at the University of Iowa long after we are gone—and we feel good about that.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/nolan.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="nolan" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>St. Louis, Missouri</p>
<p>Tom Nolan (1961 B.B.A.), of St. Louis, has lots of great memories of being a student at The University of Iowa.</p>
<p>Cheering on the Hawkeye football team. Living in Hillcrest Dormitory. Taking in plays, like &#8220;Waiting for Godot,&#8221; that were produced by the Department of Theatre Arts. Going to concerts by University bands. Participating in the professional fraternity Delta Sigma Pi.</p>
<p>But what the Iowa native remembers most fondly is how his UI education and experiences prepared him for a successful career and a fulfilling life.</p>
<p>After receiving his business degree from the University in 1961, Tom moved to St. Louis and began a training program in the Federal Housing Administration, eventually becoming a credit manager until his early retirement in 1987. That retirement proved short-lived, and he went on to work as a mortgage underwriter for two different companies for the next decade, permanently retiring in 1997.</p>
<p>Now Tom wants to help future generations of Iowans earn a UI education. He worked with The University of Iowa Foundation to include a charitable bequest in his estate planning that will create the endowed <strong>Thomas E. Nolan Business Scholarship</strong> in the UI&#8217;s <strong>Henry B. Tippie College of Business</strong>. He asked that first priority for the Nolan Scholarship be given to graduates of Benton Community High School or Vinton-Shellsburg High School in his native Benton County.</p>
<p>&#8220;In my high school, there were talented students completely deserving of a college education, but their families didn&#8217;t have the financial resources to send them to the University,&#8221; Tom remembers. &#8220;I want to help someone out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom, who also makes annual contributions to the UI, considered leaving his estate to other institutions with which he&#8217;s been involved over the years, but upon reflection decided that giving to his alma mater was the most meaningful option for him.</p>
<p>He points out, &#8220;Education is the answer for a lot of our problems. The better educated you are, the more you&#8217;ll contribute to society.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks to the Thomas E. Nolan Business Scholarship, more Iowans will be earning a UI education, developing prosperous careers, and helping their communities thrive.</p>

		<description><![CDATA["Very seldom can anyone do something that's a 'forever thing' during their life."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/mulligan.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="mulligan" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Bonita Springs, Florida, and Lake Forest, Illinois</p>
<p>The University of Iowa Hawkeye men&#8217;s swimming and diving team has its first endowed athletic scholarship, thanks to a gift of $209,000 from UI alumni <strong>Terry J. and Susan Showers Mulligan</strong> of Bonita Springs, Fla. The gift, establishing the <strong>Terry and Susan Mulligan Swimming Scholarship</strong>, was made through the UI Foundation.</p>
<p>Terry, a member of the UI football team in the 1960’s, and his wife also gave $125,000 in 2006 to establish the <strong>Susan and Terry Mulligan Football Scholarship</strong>. This gift marked the first fully endowed football scholarship given by a Hawkeye football letter winner during his lifetime.</p>
<p>&#8220;Terry and Susan Mulligan have always been strong supporters of the UI, and we&#8217;re thrilled with their generous gift to the men&#8217;s swimming and diving program,&#8221; said Marc Long, UI men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s swimming and diving head coach. &#8220;Endowing a scholarship shows a tremendous commitment and helps ensure a solid financial future for our program. I&#8217;m very grateful for their loyalty and support.&#8221;</p>
<p>UI Head Football Coach Kirk Ferentz said the Mulligan Scholarship—made as part of the <a href="http://jointheiclub.com/giving/hawkeyevisions">Hawkeye Visions Endowment Program</a>, which seeks to endow all UI athletics scholarships—will be an important part of the Hawkeyes&#8217; future success.</p>
<p>&#8220;Terry and Susan&#8217;s faith in our program will benefit Hawkeye student-athletes for generations,&#8221; Ferentz said. &#8220;Their scholarship will help the UI stay competitive against the nation&#8217;s top programs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gary Barta, the UI director of athletics, explained the importance of endowed scholarship support. &#8220;The Iowa Hawkeye athletics program is self-sustaining and receives no state funding,&#8221; Barta said. &#8220;We reimburse the university annually for every scholarship that the NCAA allows us to offer. The Mulligans&#8217; endowed scholarship gifts allow us to direct annual resources to other essential needs. I can&#8217;t thank Terry and Susan enough for their thoughtful generosity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Terry Mulligan, a UI football letter winner, said the couple&#8217;s most recent gift grew out of respect for the swimming and diving program and optimism for its future; the UI swimming and diving teams will have a new home in the <a href="/wellness">Campus Recreation and Wellness Center</a> when it opens in 2010.</p>
<p>&#8220;Coach Long and Gary Barta have worked hard to rebuild Hawkeye swimming and diving, and we&#8217;re excited to help,&#8221; Mulligan said. &#8220;Our son Jim was an All-American swimmer for the UI, and I know from my own experience as a Hawkeye football player how valuable participation in Iowa athletics can be for a student-athlete. We hope other former Hawkeyes will also lend their support to UI athletics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Terry, a three-time letterwinner who earned a B.S. degree in secondary education from Iowa in 1968, started at defensive end for the Hawkeyes in 1964, 1965, and 1966. Susan earned a B.A. degree in political science from the UI in 1967.</p>
<p>Their UI family ties are extensive. Terry&#8217;s great-grandfather and grandfather were UI law school alumni. Both of his and Susan&#8217;s sons are UI graduates: Dan Mulligan, of Morristown, N.J., earned a UI law degree in 1996, graduating with high distinction, and Jim Mulligan (1996 B.A.), of Urbandale, Iowa, was captain of the Hawkeye swim team. Jim Mulligan&#8217;s wife, Tasha Reents Mulligan (1997 B.S., 1999 M.P.T.), was an All-American on the UI softball team.</p>
<p>Terry Mulligan retired in 1996 as group vice president of medical-supplies company Baxter International. He is now vice chairman of MedAssets, a company providing financial services to healthcare providers worldwide, and serves on the board of directors for Wellmark Inc.</p>
<p>The UI presented Terry with the Distinguished Alumni Award in 2001, and he served on the UI Alumni Association&#8217;s board of directors for seven years, including two as chairman. He is a member of the UI Henry B. Tippie College of Business board of visitors, and both he and Susan are members of the <a href="/pc/">UI Presidents Club</a>, which recognizes the university&#8217;s most generous contributors.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/moran.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="moran" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Cedar Rapids, Iowa</p>
<p>The day Regan Moran turned one should have been cause for celebration. Instead it started the Morans on an unsettling medical journey—a journey that would give a new focus to their lives.</p>
<p>On November 2, 2001, Regan awoke on his birthday with a common childhood ailment, a double ear infection. Despite taking antibiotics, his condition worsened and within days, he was admitted to Mercy Medical Center in Cedar Rapids with what doctors thought was meningitis. By November 9, Regan began having seizures, and early on November 11 he fell into a coma. Anxious and no longer certain Regan had meningitis, the family and doctors agreed Regan should be airlifted that day to University of Iowa Children’s Hospital to receive the specialized care he needed.</p>
<p>“His symptoms were the perfect storm of deadly proportions,” Regan’s father, Michael, recalls. “All we knew was that if Mercy was our first line of defense, there was no doubt in our minds that the next place we wanted him to be was at UI Children’s Hospital.”</p>
<p>UI neurologist Kathy Mathews, M.D., met the family in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, and Regan’s mom, Anne Marie, says Mathews’ sense of calm and quiet confidence gave the family hope. It was determined that Regan had viral encephalitis, or a virus in the brain. Over the next few days he steadily improved, and on November 19, Regan went home. Today, he is a healthy second grader at St. Pius Elementary School in Cedar Rapids.</p>
<p>Michael and Anne Marie say the experience has given their family a shared purpose. “UI Children’s Hospital is always going to be the first one on our list to support, because we feel so blessed,” says Anne Marie. “No amount of money could ever repay what the staff there did for us, though that’s not the only reason we give; we want to instill in our children the idea that you give to help other people, not just because someone has helped you.”</p>
<p>The message is working. A couple of years ago, Regan and his sister Quinlan, 12, donated proceeds from their neighborhood lemonade stand to UI Children’s Hospital. This year, the Moran family gave nearly $100,000, and Michael’s mother, Ann Moran, and her husband, Robert Wigley, also pledged $100,000.</p>
<p>“We saw how vital the care was that UI Children’s Hospital gave to Regan, and we want to support that,” Ann said. “In terms of giving, Michael and Anne Marie are excellent role models. They live their lives that way, giving and sharing. And because of it, they are creating another generation of people who are learning to give back.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/mills-scriabine.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="mills-scriabine" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Columbia, Missouri</p>
<p>Mount Pleasant, Iowa, natives Dean Mills and Sue Cornick Mills have enjoyed highly successful careers since graduating from The University of Iowa in 1965, and both credit the life-changing education they received at Iowa for setting the stage for their success.</p>
<p>Dean came to the UI with dreams of becoming a journalist. He worked nearly full-time at <em>The Daily Iowan</em> to put himself through school and graduated with degrees in Journalism and Russian. Sue started out at Drake University in Des Moines and transferred to the UI as a junior, graduating with a degree in Psychology. The couple married just one day after graduation.</p>
<p>Sue has spent most of her career as a fundraiser, first at Penn State, and for the last 22 years, at The University of Missouri. Dean spent several years as a reporter for the <em>Baltimore Sun</em> papers, first in the states, and then in Moscow, before pursuing a master’s degree and a doctorate. He is currently dean of the School of Journalism at The University of Missouri. Along the way, the couple had two children, Jason and Jesse (2001, M.D.).</p>
<p>During his time at the UI, Dean made the life-changing decision to take a Russian class with then UI faculty member Orest Ochrymowycz. He continued his studies with longtime professor and author <strong>Helene Scriabine</strong>.</p>
<p>“Professor Scriabine instilled a love for Russian language and culture in hundreds of students lucky enough to have her for a teacher,” says Dean. “It was because of her inspirational teaching that I added a second major in Russian, which eventually contributed to my stint as a correspondent in Russia.”</p>
<p>Dean and Sue value the education they received at the UI, and they understand that financial assistance is essential for many students. They recently made a deferred gift commitment to benefit students in the <strong>UI Department of Asian and Slavic Languages and Literatures and the UI School of Journalism and Mass Communication</strong>, and chose to do so in honor of three of Dean’s most influential mentors.</p>
<p>The couple, <em>who named the UI as a beneficiary of part of their retirement plan assets</em>, established the <strong>Helene Scriabine Undergraduate Prize in Russian Studies</strong>, which will be awarded annually to a deserving student pursuing a major or minor in Russian or Russian Studies. Additionally, the <strong>John and Shirley Harrison Prize in Journalism</strong> will be given to an upper-level undergraduate student in the UI School of Journalism and Mass Communication who demonstrates an interest in international affairs.</p>
<p>“John Harrison was my first journalism advisor at Iowa,” Dean recalls. “When my modest scholarship support and the job at the DI weren&#8217;t providing me enough money to stay in school, John and Shirley invented various jobs at their house on weekends to keep me afloat financially.”</p>
<p>Because both funds will be set up as endowments, generations of UI students will benefit from Dean and Sue’s generous gift.</p>
<p>“Like thousands of Iowa grads, we were transformed by our years at Iowa,” says Dean. “We can never begin to repay the University for that, but we hope our gift will help the UI continue to transform the lives of students.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/mikhail.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="mikhail" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Rochester, Minnesota</p>
<p>In fifth grade, Amanda Mikhail dismantled a car engine and put it back together. This experience sparked her lifelong interest in figuring out how things work—and how to make them work better. That’s why the 1999 University of Iowa graduate, with a B.S.E. degree in mechanical engineering, is now a manager at IBM in Rochester, Minnesota, with 19 patents to her name. It’s also why she currently is the youngest contributor to fund an endowed scholarship in the UI College of Engineering.</p>
<p>Through a $50,000 gift commitment to the UI Foundation to establish the Amanda and Michael Mikhail Engineering Scholarship, this Presidents Club member is creating new opportunities for UI women in the field of mechanical engineering. “The engineering faculty taught me how to think like an engineer, how to solve problems, and how to grow as a person and as a professional,” says Mikhail.</p>
<p>Such academic experiences paid off for Mikhail, who works in a field that’s nearly 95 percent male. Her interests evolved from carburetors to contact physics, and after 10 years at IBM—during which she also completed an M.B.A. degree at the University of Minnesota in Rochester—she now oversees a department of 17 mechanical analysis and thermal engineers who are responsible for IBM’s mid-range server product set.</p>
<p>Mikhail credits Iowa with her success: “I am who I am because of Iowa, and I wanted to help the next wave of young engineers—particularly women,” she says. “I was a scholarship recipient, and it was time to pay my good fortune forward.”</p>
<p>Thanks to her degree and her membership in the College of Engineering’s Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Advisory Board, Mikhail clearly understands the power of an Iowa engineering education—and the potential of future generations.</p>
<p>“The University itself is such a gift. It represents a legacy begun long ago, and this legacy reminds us that not only do our gifts sustain Iowa, but they also inspire the next generation to maintain this momentum of giving.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/liberal-arts1.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="liberal-arts1" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Davenport, Iowa</p>
<p>When Ross McFadden (1940 B.A., 1943 M.D.) was a University of Iowa student, he laid the foundation for a prosperous career. But his time in Iowa City wasn&#8217;t all hitting the books—he also had a lot of fun and made a lot of great friends.</p>
<p>McFadden&#8217;s gratitude for both of these facets of his UI education led him to establish his Iowa philanthropic legacy by <a href="/gp/vol19/email.html">making the UI Foundation a beneficiary of his retirement plan assets</a> after his death. He also enjoys regular guaranteed annuity payments during his lifetime, thanks to a <a href="/gp/vol17/email.html">charitable gift annuity</a> he established with the UI Foundation. His gifts will provide crucial unrestricted support for the <a href="http://www.givetoiowa.org/clas/">College of Liberal Arts and Sciences</a> and the <a href="http://www.givetoiowa.org/medicine/">UI Roy J. and Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m where I am today because of Iowa, especially the medical school, and I wanted to pay back,&#8221; says McFadden, who practiced obstetrics in Davenport, Iowa, throughout his career. &#8220;I made some of my very best friends there, and the University was always helpful when I needed professional advice.&#8221;</p>
<p>McFadden notes that his wife, Mary Elise (1940 B.A.), died of ovarian cancer in 1994, so he wanted to use his assets to help his alma mater help people in need— and he believes the UI medical school is doing a terrific job of educating the next generation of physicians.</p>
<p>&#8220;Young doctors today who come out of the UI are excellent doctors, extremely well trained,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>McFadden understood that to meet his philanthropic goals of paying back his alma mater and ensuring that a UI medical education sustains its excellence, it was in his best financial interests to make a charitable bequest of his retirement plan assets. In particular, he knew that using retirement assets to make his bequest carries significant tax advantages. And if circumstances change during his lifetime, he can always amend his bequest to meet his needs.</p>
<p>McFadden has felt a lifelong connection to the UI. &#8220;I have a real soft spot for the University,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It&#8217;s been very dear to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks to his generosity, many future students will share his love for The University of Iowa.</p>

		<description><![CDATA["We hope this will give the coach a way to attract and retain a new generation of women rowers."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/mccord.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="mccord" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Iowa City, Iowa</p>
<p>Darlene E. and James &#8220;Jim&#8221; B. (1969 B.S., 1972 M.A., 1974 Ph.D.) McCord believe in the power of character and commitment. These qualities are what inspired the two to form the McCord Foundation, which has made a generous gift of $75,000 for the new P. Sue Beckwith, M.D., Boathouse. They&#8217;re also the guiding principles by which the couple lives.</p>
<p>&#8220;This contribution is about Iowa&#8217;s women rowers,&#8221; says Darlene McCord. &#8220;It&#8217;s about their commitment to rowing, to the team, to the University. We value this kind of dedication, and we wanted to make a gift in recognition of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no surprise that the McCords would want to recognize such perseverance and hard work. The same values helped them establish McCord Research, an Iowa-based corporation that researches and develops high-quality products for wound and skin care. Darlene McCord—a biochemist with a Ph.D. degree from the University of California at Berkeley who specializes in the chemistry of skin-product formulation—is the company&#8217;s senior researcher, and Jim McCord is the director of business development. Prior to this, Jim McCord was dean at East Los Angeles College and Los Angeles Southwest College.</p>
<p>Together, the McCords are members of The Presidents Club, which recognizes the UI&#8217;s highest-level contributors, and they have used their professional success to give back generously to others—including Iowa&#8217;s women rowers. &#8220;Whether you&#8217;re a scientist or an athlete, you must persevere to reach that goal line,&#8221; says Darlene McCord. &#8220;You have to reach for something deep inside of you and keep striving. We hope this gift will help these young women do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim McCord admits that before meeting with Head Coach Mandi Kowal, neither he nor his wife knew much about the rowing team&#8217;s pressing need for a new facility. Now, they understand just what a difference their gift—which will name a dock at the new boathouse—will make for these UI athletes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope this will give the coach a way to attract and retain a new generation of women rowers,&#8221; says Jim McCord. &#8220;It&#8217;s amazing that Coach Kowal has done as well as she has, given the resources she&#8217;s had to work with in the past.&#8221;</p>
<p>Darlene McCord agrees: &#8220;It&#8217;s all about the coach and her players—and their amazing level of teamwork. We hope our foundation&#8217;s gift will tell these athletes: &#8216;We support you. We respect you. You represent the UI with dignity and pride—and that deserves recognition.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks to the vision and generosity of contributors like the McCords, current and future generations of UI women rowers will be able to show their Iowa pride on the water—and in the boathouse.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/student-aid3.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="student-aid3" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>The late Mildred McCarrel never knew UI graduate Garth Strohbehn—but she helped him on his way to a medical career.</p>
<p>When McCarrel, who died in 1999, established a charitable gift annuity (CGA) and a charitable bequest through The University of Iowa Foundation to support scholarships for UI students, Garth, Class of 2008, wasn&#8217;t even in high school yet.</p>
<p>However, McCarrel—who was the widow of former UI dean of students Ted McCarrel, who died in 1988—knew that the UI offered exceptional educational opportunities for talented students, and she wanted to help them succeed. She also needed to maintain guaranteed quarterly annuity payments in her retirement years. McCarrel found that a CGA was an answer to both her long-term philanthropic wishes and her immediate financial concerns. And her CGA brought her tax benefits as well.</p>
<p>If she had met Garth, who grew up outside of Gilbert, Iowa, McCarrel would surely feel that her philanthropic goals were fulfilled. A beneficiary of McCarrel&#8217;s far-sighted gift, he graduated from Iowa with a dual major, in chemistry and biochemistry, and a minor in political science. He conducted research in UI laboratories, and was the chair of the College Student Leader Board, coordinating all the student volunteers throughout UI Hospitals and Clinics. He went on to earn a master of philosophy degree at Cambridge University in England before entering medical school at Yale University.</p>
<p>In short, Garth is an example of the professional and civic leaders whom the UI is known for developing—thanks in part to McCarrel&#8217;s philanthropic leadership in the past. &#8220;The scholarships I received made my UI experience possible,&#8221; Garth says. &#8220;Without that support, instead of working in labs, I&#8217;d have been struggling to make ends meet while in college. My scholarships allowed me to focus on my studies. I&#8217;m very grateful.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/mcbride.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="mcbride" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Cape Coral, Florida</p>
<p>Justin D. McBride (1996 B.S.) got a lot more from The University of Iowa than a college education. To hear him tell it, he got a life.</p>
<p>Justin grew up in Iowa City, where his dad, Bunny McBride, was a College of Liberal Arts and Sciences professor, the head of the ceramics program in the School of Art and Art History, and an internationally acclaimed ceramics artist. The McBride home was filled with art—and often with artists visiting the UI from all over the world, whom Bunny and his wife, Arlene, hosted and fed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our lives revolved around art,&#8221; Justin said. &#8220;Dad especially wanted to bring back alumni who had gone on to be working artists, to show his students what was possible for their careers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Justin graduated from the UI with a bachelor’s degree in environmental geography, and now works for Lee County, Florida, protecting manatees and preserving the environment in his shoreline community. He also serves on the board of directors for the University of Iowa Alumni Association and as president of the association’s Paradise IOWA Club for alumni and friends living in the Ft. Myers area.</p>
<p>Even though he didn’t become a professional artist himself, Justin said, &#8220;The prevalence of art and culture in my home and in the UI community enriched my life and helped give me a broader perspective. And I always deeply admired my father and his work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bunny McBride retired from the college in July 2010—a milestone that inspired Justin and his wife, Annette, to make a generous bequest in Bunny’s honor to support the Bunny McBride Visiting Artist Fund in Ceramics. Bunny and Arlene, along with other friends and family members, have also made gifts to support the fund.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the reasons the UI has a world-class program is our historical focus on international dialogue, and our ability to keep up with what’s going on in the medium, all over the world,&#8221; Bunny said. &#8220;I hope this fund will help the UI continue to bring artists here for that perspective.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/marvin.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="marvin" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Bartlett, New Hampshire</p>
<p>Prisca Marvin didn’t attend The University of Iowa, and she’s only been on campus a handful of times. But the former patent attorney turned autism advocate is a strong supporter of the UI College of Education’s Realizing Educational And Career Hopes (REACH) program, a two-year certificate program providing residential post-secondary educational opportunities on the UI campus for young adults with multiple learning disabilities.</p>
<p>Prisca, who lives in Bartlett, New Hampshire, with her husband, Kim, and daughters, Victory and Helen, began actively advocating for those with autism in 1999 while serving as the primary caretaker for Helen, who has autism. During her service as a trustee for the National Alliance for Autism Research, Prisca worked alongside former Iowa Lieutenant Governor and current REACH advisory board chair, Sally Pederson. Prisca learned more about REACH, and soon agreed to join the advisory board.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think one of the greatest strengths of REACH is the amount of research and preparation that was done to create the curriculum,&#8221; says Prisca. &#8220;It is remarkably organic, in that it is highly responsive to the particular needs of individual students, and the pairing from the start with potential employers—giving the students a tangible goal as well as a sense of self worth—is key to their success.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because of the small class sizes and the individual support REACH provides, the tuition is significantly higher than for mainstream students. And since REACH participants do not qualify for federal aid, private gift support from friends like Prisca is critical to the program’s success.</p>
<p>&#8220;I support REACH because even though my own daughter is too profoundly autistic to be capable of independent living, I see this population of young adults as one of vast potential,&#8221; says Prisca. &#8220;With the guidance of REACH faculty and staff, these young men and women can be lifelong contributors to society.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Prisca worked with the UI Foundation to set up a monthly contribution to the REACH fund</strong>, which provides need-based scholarship assistance to students in the program.</p>
<p>&#8220;I strongly encourage others to also give what they can to REACH. This program contributes to an entire lifetime of productivity and self-actualization for its graduates,&#8221; says Prisca. &#8220;These students are willing to work hard, and we need to do our part.&#8221;</p>

<p>An Iowa City native, <strong>David L. Maher</strong> received his B.S. degree from the College of Pharmacy in 1964. In addition, he lettered as a member of the Hawkeye basketball team.</p>
<p>In 1963, David began his career with American Stores, better known locally as Osco Drug, in 1963, first as a clerk and after graduation as a pharmacist.</p>
<p>By the time he retired from the company 36 years later, he was vice chairman and chief operating officer of American Stores, and had held seats on state and national pharmacy advisory boards and served as chairman of the National Association of Chain Drug Stores.</p>
<p>While he no longer lives in Iowa, David remains close to the College of Pharmacy in spirit, and made a lead gift to help remodel the distributing lab into a state-of-the-art practice laboratory. The new facility, called the <strong>David and Marilyn Maher Pharmaceutical Care Laboratory</strong>, provides a realistic setting where students can practice everything from counseling patients to distributing medications.</p>
<p>A member of the Dean&#8217;s Advisory Council, the Alumni Association Old Capitol Club, and The Presidents Club of The University of Iowa, Mr. Maher has received the Distinguished Alumni Award from both the College of Pharmacy and the University of Iowa Alumni Association. He has also pledged a major gift toward the University&#8217;s comprehensive campaign.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s pharmacy students need the type of patient-focused, hands-on learning in which Iowa specializes,&#8221; he says. &#8220;And since Iowa provides the great majority of pharmacists for the state, an excellent program will help meet the state&#8217;s growing health care needs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I enjoy being able to give back by helping the college provide the best possible education to help students succeed.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/hospitals1.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="hospitals1" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Epworth, Iowa</p>
<p>Sometimes, a good response to grief is having fun with friends and family. Thus was born the annual Clownin&#8217; Around Golf Open, which supports the <strong>Martha Maahs Hepatitis C Research Fund</strong> at University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics.</p>
<p>When Martha Maahs of Epworth, Iowa, was diagnosed in 1998 with Hepatitis C, her family physician referred her to Dr. Michael Voigt, a clinical specialist at UI Hospitals and Clinics and an associate professor of internal medicine in the UI Roy J. and Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine. The disease, which Martha had contracted from a blood transfusion in 1981 (blood products are now routinely screened for the virus), had caused cirrhosis of the liver.</p>
<p>Sadly, Martha&#8217;s condition was too far advanced to be cured, and she died in 2000. During the time she was treated at the UI, however, <strong>she received compassionate care that significantly eased her and her family&#8217;s suffering</strong>.</p>
<p>&#8220;My mother spent many weeks in the hospital under Dr. Voigt&#8217;s care. She respected him and trusted his opinion, and <strong>she always felt she received the best care</strong> from him,&#8221; said Martha&#8217;s daughter, Niki Perrenoud of Farley, Iowa. &#8220;Dr. Voigt was always happy to sit down with the family and explain what was happening.&#8221;</p>
<p>To show their gratitude, Perrenoud and her family—Mike Maahs of Dyersville, Iowa; Tony and Bruce Maahs of Epworth; and her late father, Dick Maahs—established the research fund in Martha&#8217;s name with the assistance of the UI Foundation.</p>
<p>To support the fund, the family holds the annual golf outing, named in honor of Martha&#8217;s fondness for clowns and clown memorabilia. Friends, family, and community members join in the fun, and area individuals and businesses sponsor holes. The golf event is followed by a dinner, raffle, and silent auction, with entertainment for the guests. Those interested in making reservations or donations for future golf outings may contact Niki Perrenoud at (563) 744-3081 or <a href="mailto:snperrenoud@iowatelecom.net">snperrenoud@iowatelecom.net</a>.</p>
<p>Martha&#8217;s death was a tragedy for her family<em>,</em> but <strong>now future patients will benefit from the family&#8217;s desire to give back to UI Hospital and Clinics</strong>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/athletics1.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="athletics" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Iowa City, Iowa</p>
<p><strong>Ailene Liechty</strong> couldn’t play sports in public. The child of a strict Pennsylvania Dutch horse trainer, she wasn’t allowed to shine on an organized sports team. However, thanks to inspiration from one of her daughters, Linda Mordaunt, Ailene Liechty now has given University of Iowa women rowers the chance to shine—both on and off the water. </p>
<p>Though Liechty died in October 2007, just one month shy of her 100th birthday, her independent spirit and love of adventure will help inspire future generations of UI women rowers. Liechty and her other daughter, Karen Schreiner (1963 M.A.), with encouragement from Mordaunt, joined together to make a generous gift of $25,000 to name the Medical Training Room in the new <a href="/boathouse/">P. Sue Beckwith, M.D., Boathouse</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;My mother was very strong and very independent. She loved organized sports, but she never was allowed to play them herself, which is why I thought it was so fitting for her to support this important project,&#8221; says Linda Mordaunt, an ardent Hawkeye fan who is herself a generous UI giver and member of The Presidents Club. Both she and her husband, Dick, who was a senior adjuster at Pekin Insurance and died in November 2007, supported the UI.</p>
<p>After leaving the family farm in Zearing, Iowa, Ailene Liechty received a B.A. degree in education from Drake University in 1929 and taught elementary education in Polk City. She married E. J. Liechty in the front parlor of her family home, and they had four children: Karen, John (1960 B.S.E.E.), Linda, and Joe. Her husband went on to become publisher of the Iowa City Press-Citizen and then a director of Gannett Company, Inc.</p>
<p>&#8220;My mom and dad just instilled in all of us children the idea that you give back. You give back to your church, to your city, and to your University,&#8221; says Mordaunt. &#8220;Even though both my parents were Drake University graduates, they still firmly believed in supporting The University of Iowa because it was part of the community where they lived and worked.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mordaunt, who grew up in Iowa City, said her parents also taught her to embrace her interests. They supported her athletic endeavors, even buying her a horse named &#8220;Princess&#8221;— which she rode on Taft Speedway, right past the site where the new boathouse will be built.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really encouraged my mother to include women’s sports in her giving because she always supported my sister and me—and all us siblings—in our athletic pursuits,&#8221; says Mordaunt.</p>
<p>Though she never had the chance to take to the water herself, Ailene Liechty’s lively spirit and love of competition will live on through each new class of Iowa women rowers who train in the P. Sue Beckwith, M.D., Boathouse.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/lane.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="lane" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Omaha, Nebraska</p>
<div style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;width:320px;background-color:#1c1c1c;padding-bottom:10px;">
<div align="center" style="color:#FFCC00;font-size:13px;"><img src="http://www.uifoundation.org/donors/images/body/lane.jpg" alt="Curt and Carol Lane" border="0" style="padding-bottom:5px;" /><br /><em>Carol Brindley Lane and Curtis K. Lane</em></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Curt Lane</strong> was already a successful entrepreneur and savvy investor before he graduated from high school in Atlantic, Iowa. He earned money through mowing lawns, refinishing furniture, and other odd jobs, and used the proceeds to buy stock in companies like IBM, Monsanto, and Safeway—making tens of thousands of dollars before he even left home.</p>
<p>He earned his B.B.A. degree in finance and insurance from the University of Iowa College of Business in 1973—but not before he struggled with organic chemistry and left the UI and his pre-dental major, met the girl of his dreams (Carol Brindley, now his wife) in his hometown, and was drafted for military service in Vietnam.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had never fired a gun in my life,&#8221; Curt recalls. &#8220;But I had to rise to the occasion. I vowed that if I made it out alive, I&#8217;d do two things—marry that girl and graduate from college.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did make it out alive, but barely, and spent a year recovering in a stateside veterans&#8217; hospital before he made good on both of his promises.</p>
<p>In 1971 he married Carol, who had also withdrawn from the UI, and together they returned to campus to complete their degrees. Carol also received her B.A. degree from the UI in 1973—majoring in home economics—and Curt went on to earn his M.B.A. degree from the University of Nebraska. Since then he has managed institutional performance portfolios including mutual funds, trust funds, and pension funds on Wall Street, in Minneapolis, and most recently, at Concordant Partners, L.L.C., a hedge fund he co-founded in Omaha, Nebraska. He is a member of the board of directors at the UI Foundation, the Tippie Advisory Board in the UI Henry B. Tippie College of business, and is chair of the Investment Committee for the Iowa Scholarship Fund in the UI Department of Intercollegiate Athletics.</p>
<p>Carol says, &#8220;We both got a second chance to succeed at the University of Iowa. It was important to both of us, and our time here was a great start to our life together. Now we want to complete the circle.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the Lanes, that means providing generous support to the University of Iowa and its students—including a recent $5 million gift commitment. <!-- replaced reference to 2011 with "recent"--></p>
<p>Of the $5 million total, $1 million will be added to the <strong>Curt and Carol Lane Faculty Fellowship</strong> fund they created in 2003 to support practical learning opportunities for students studying finance, Curt&#8217;s line of work and his passion. An additional $2 million will create a scholarship fund for Tippie finance students.</p>
<p>Curt says, &#8220;Right now the fellowship supports Professor Todd Hogue, who teaches Applied Investments—a class that gives students a chance to actually experience the work of managing investments. That&#8217;s what they crave, and it’s the kind of experience that can give UI graduates an edge in the job market.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Lanes, who drive to Iowa City from Omaha for every home football game, also committed $2 million to provide scholarships for Hawkeye Football student-athletes.<br />
&#8220;We never had children of our own,&#8221; explains Carol. &#8220;We&#8217;re as devoted to the success of UI students as if they were our own—and the Hawkeye football players are definitely our boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>Curt agrees: &#8220;We always root for the Hawkeyes—even when they play Nebraska. We&#8217;re Black and Gold, down to the bone.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Lanes&#8217; generous assistance to UI students does come with a message, though. Curt and Carol encourage the students they support to make it a priority to complete the circle of gratitude and giving for themselves. As Curt says, &#8220;We like to impress upon recipients the expectation that they will give back, too, when they’re able.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/lakin.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="lakin" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p> What will you be doing in 2055? University of Iowa Professor Emeritus Jean A. Lakin (1982 Ph.D.) will be bringing beautiful music and better health care into the world. </p>
<p> A former professor in the College of Nursing, Jean honored the memory of her husband James E. Lakin—director and professor in the School of Music in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences for 21 years until his untimely death in 1988—by creating a legacy that will ensure that the couple’s impact as teachers and community leaders will continue far into the future.</p>
<p> “Jim and I valued our careers as educators, but it was important to us to extend our work beyond the academic world,” says Jean. “I like the idea of creating scholarships that will support future students who share our professional interests, as well as our commitment to linking the University and the community.” </p>
<p>She adds, “I also know from experience how helpful such assistance can be, especially for graduate students with families.”</p>
<p>Jean and James Lakin created two scholarships through two types of deferred gifts. The Lakins, like many people in their situation, wanted to make sure they had enough resources for their retirement and to provide support in case of unforeseen health and economic issues. They also wanted to provide future support for loved ones.</p>
<p>With those concerns in mind, they worked with their advisor and decided to make their gift in the form of a simple bequest and a charitable remainder trust.</p>
<p>The bequest allowed Jean and James to make their future commitment while maintaining control over their resources for current needs. The charitable remainder trust will provide income to a chosen beneficiary, in this case their son, with the eventual proceeds benefiting the University.</p>
<p>The James and Jean Lakin Woodwind Scholarship will provide support for a promising UI graduate student studying oboe in the School of Music, with preference given to an individual interested in a teaching career that involves community outreach.</p>
<p>The James and Jean Lakin Public Health Scholarship will provide funding for a graduate student in the College of Public Health who demonstrates outstanding leadership potential and who has interest in pursuing a teaching career in higher education or in a leadership position at the local or state level.</p>
<p>“We’re so grateful to The University of Iowa for providing an excellent environment where we could lead satisfying careers in education,” Jean explains. “I hope this gift will inspire others to honor colleagues or loved ones by creating a lasting legacy at the University.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/hospitals1.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="hospitals1" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Reston, Virginia</p>
<p>University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics contributor Robert Klein and his family were visiting his parents six years ago when something odd piqued his curiosity.</p>
<p>&#8220;We noticed that my oldest son&#8217;s (James) jaw-line was sagging,&#8221; says Klein, who lives with his wife, Suzanne, and other sons, Matt and Scott, in Reston, Virginia. &#8220;We thought maybe he had swollen lymph nodes so we took him to a doctor.&#8221;</p>
<p>A CT scan performed by a local otolaryngologist provided a surprise diagnosis: lymphatic malformation or lymphangioma. Lymphatic malformations occur when the lymphatic system develops abnormally in children. These malformations can range from mild to severe and most commonly appear in the head and neck. The lesions might enlarge with a cold or illness, or fluctuate in size, but typically do not go away on their own.</p>
<p>While surgery has typically been the treatment of choice, the rate of recurrence for lymphangioma lesions is often as high as 50 percent. That&#8217;s why the Kleins were intrigued when their otolaryngologist mentioned <strong>a new study being conducted at University of Iowa Children&#8217;s Hospital</strong>, a part of University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics.</p>
<p>Klein had never been to Iowa and had no idea the University&#8217;s Department of Otolaryngology&#8211;Head and Neck Surgery was so highly regarded. However, the Virginia physician&#8217;s comments led the Kleins to make a series of calls to Diane Burke, R.N., the study&#8217;s nurse coordinator, and to otolaryngologist Richard J. H. Smith, M.D., who initiated the study. </p>
<p>Johns Hopkins University was one of 12 U.S. sites for the study, so the Kleins went there for the first two treatments called for in the study&#8217;s protocol. The third and final treatment would have been given there as well, but the doctor had left for a position at another institution.</p>
<p>At that point the Kleins decided to <strong>seek the third injection from the experts they had gotten to know and love on the telephone</strong>. So in November 2001, they packed up the car and drove from Virginia to Iowa City and the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. </p>
<p>&#8220;It was the perfect opportunity to get the best treatment for James and finally meet Diane Burke and Dr. Smith,&#8221; Klein says. &#8220;When we arrived at the clinic we could hear their voices in another room and we knew who it was.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith says the outlook for James is excellent. &#8220;He had what we call complete resolution of his cystic hygroma. Patients have a two-year follow-up period once they are done with treatment so we will be monitoring any recurrence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Robert Klein was so pleased and impressed with the service and expertise his family received at UI Hospitals and Clinics that he wrote two letters: one to his congressman encouraging federal support for the OK-432 trial, and the other <strong>encouraging relatives to donate to UI&#8217;s treatment and research efforts in the area of lymphangioma</strong>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We asked our family to help, and they made some nice gifts,&#8221; Klein says. &#8220;We all consider it money well spent.&#8221; (Learn more about or contribute to the <a href="http://www.givetoiowa.org/lymphangioma">Lymphangioma Research Fund</a>.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/dentistry.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="College of Dentistry" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Clinton, Iowa</p>
<p>After the untimely death of Richard J. Kist, D.D.S., M.S., in an auto accident in March 2004, his family and friends felt that creating a scholarship in his name would be the best possible living memorial to a great man.</p>
<p>The Richard J. Kist Student Award enables this proud UI alumnus&#8212;who at one time had six grandchildren enrolled at Iowa&#8212;to continue to give back to The University of Iowa in perpetuity. </p>
<p>Born in Eagle Grove, Iowa, Kist graduated from the University of Iowa College of Dentistry in 1954. He served as a captain in the U.S. Air Force in Japan until 1956, at which time he returned to the UI and entered oral surgery training at University Hospitals. After completing his UI residency in 1958 and receiving his M.S. degree in 1959, he became chief of oral surgery at Thompson Clinic in St. Joseph, Missouri. He started a private practice in Clinton, Iowa, in 1960, where he worked until the time of his death.</p>
<p>In 1997, Kist became an adjunct professor of oral and maxillofacial surgery at the UI, where he was chosen as Adjunct of the Year in 1999 and 2000. He had a great love of reading and teaching, and he enjoyed challenging his students. Kist also was active in many community organizations and taught classes in the Iowa Chapter of the American Heart Association.</p>
<p>Each year, the Kist scholarship&#8212;established by his wife, Phyllis, his four daughters, his sons-in-law, his nine grandchildren, and his friend and colleague William J. Synan (1988 F.)&#8212;is awarded to a senior dental student and graduate of an Iowa high school who is deserving of financial aid, dedicated to community organizations, and planning to practice in Iowa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Scholarships like this make a real difference, as they allow you to focus on school instead of worrying about finances,&#8221; said <a href="/students/jordan-solberg/">Jordan Solberg</a>, the 2005-2006 recipient of the Kist Award. &#8220;It really means a lot to receive a gift that honors another graduate who cared so much about the dentistry profession, the University, and the state of Iowa.&#8221;</p>

<p>Most University of Iowa law graduates are intent on passing the bar. But Charles &#8220;Chuck&#8221; M. Kierscht is intent on <em>surpassing</em> the bar, especially when it comes to supporting his alma mater.</p>
<p>As a 1962 College of Law alumnus, Kierscht credits the UI with giving him the start that led to 29 successful years with Kemper Financial Services, where he served as chairman and CEO before retiring to practice law in Chicago.</p>
<p>Throughout the years, he has more than repaid this &#8220;debt of gratitude&#8221; through his extraordinary commitment to The University of Iowa.</p>
<p>The Des Moines native made his first gift to the College of Law nearly 40 years ago and has been a Presidents Club member since 1988, supporting everything from the Museum of Natural History to UI athletics to Old Capitol.</p>
<p>To honor his father, a 1934 graduate of the UI College of Dentistry, Kierscht and his wife, Marion, also established the Dr. Charles N. and Florence M. Kierscht Scholarship Fund for dental students with financial need. </p>
<p>Most recently, Kierscht stepped up as chair of the Iowa Law School Endowment Campaign for the 21st Century. And he helped kick off the campaign with a $1 million gift to create the Charles M. and Marion J. Kierscht Law Endowment Fund, which provides faculty support, merit scholarships, and resources for the Iowa Law Library. </p>
<p>&#8220;I owe my professional career to The University of Iowa College of Law,&#8221; Kierscht says. &#8220;I believe it is our obligation to do what we can to see that those who come after us have the opportunities provided by a University of Iowa education.&#8221; </p>
<p>It is this kind of leadership that demonstrates why Chuck Kierscht is setting the bar for excellence at The University of Iowa.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/student-aid31.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="student-aid3" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Moline, Illinois</p>
<p>When Jim Hanson&#8217;s father, the late Clem Hanson, graduated in 1920 as valedictorian of his high school class in Riverside, Iowa, he received a scholarship to attend The University of Iowa.</p>
<p>That was a defining moment for the Hanson family, one that served to shape it for future generations.</p>
<p>The scholarship gave the blacksmith&#8217;s son an opportunity he otherwise would not have had&#8212;to earn a top-notch UI education&#8212;and he met his wife, Sylvia (1927 B.A.), at the University to boot.</p>
<p>Clem Hanson graduated with a B.S.C. degree in 1925, and went on to develop a successful advertising career&#8212;and a life devoted to giving back to the UI and his community of Moline, Illinois.</p>
<p>Now, Jim Hanson (1958 B.S.C.) and his wife, Joann (1956 B.A.), who live in Moline, are carrying on the Hanson family tradition of philanthropy and civic service. They created the James C. and Joann S. Hanson Scholarships at the UI, designed for excellent students who have volunteered in their communities.</p>
<p>&#8220;My parents were mentors,&#8221; Jim explained. &#8220;Their example led all of us to understand that giving is a healthy thing to do. They taught us that <strong>you don&#8217;t have to be the biggest giver, but you should make a significant contribution to society in whatever ways you&#8217;re able</strong>.</p>
<p>&#8220;When it came to giving back to the UI, Joann and I understood that there&#8217;s more need for scholarships than anything else. We&#8217;re proud to have an influence on the University by helping to bring outstanding students to study there,&#8221; he said, adding that the couple takes great joy in meeting the students who receive the scholarships they created. The UI Alumni Association named Jim a Distinguished Alumnus in 2003.</p>
<p>Jim has followed in his father&#8217;s footsteps in other ways, too. Not only is he retired from the Moline advertising firm his father founded, but like Clem, he serves on the UI Foundation Board of Directors. And he and Joann, a retired educator, are very active as philanthropists and volunteers in civic organizations, keeping his parents&#8217; legacy of generosity and commitment alive in the Moline area.</p>
<p>Thanks to Joann and Jim Hanson, generations of enterprising young scholars will acquire the same life-changing gift that Clem Hanson received years ago&#8212;a UI education.</p>

		<description><![CDATA["We've had so much fun collecting these pieces. It feels right to be able to give back..."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/january.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="january" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Indianapolis, Indiana</p>
<p>Ann and Alan January have shared a lifelong passion for collecting art prints—and each attributes a love of the fine arts to being raised in Iowa’s rich culture of visual arts and artists.  That is why they have chosen to give back to the UI and to Iowa in a meaningful and unique way.</p>
<p>The Iowa natives met at the UI in the late 1960s, where Alan was working on a Ph.D. in history and Ann was pursuing graduate work in political science.  After marrying in 1970, the couple started collecting original paintings and prints together.  One of their fondest memories from their early years in Iowa City is attending the historic opening of the UI Museum of Art (UIMA)  in 1969.  </p>
<p>When the Januarys moved to Indianapolis in 1978 to pursue careers there, Alan put his research skills to work—he is director of the Indiana State Archives—to learn more about American printmaking. Through the 40 years that they have pursued their “hobby,” they have built an important, varied, and valuable collection of American prints from 1900 to 1950.</p>
<p>They have also maintained close ties to Iowa City and the University—and when Howard Collinson became director of the UIMA in 2000, they rekindled a relationship with the museum as well.  In fact, when it was time to plan for their collection’s future, they decided to leave it to the museum, a generous gift that will be enjoyed—and studied—by future generations of students, faculty, and others in the community.</p>
<p>In addition to this generous gift, the Januarys have supported the UIMA through outright gifts, and they plan to create an endowed fund to care for the collection.  They have also generously supported the UI Libraries, Hancher Auditorium, the UI Carver College of Medicine, and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.  </p>
<p>“We’ve had so much fun collecting these pieces,” says Ann.  “It feels right to be able to give back in this meaningful way to a community that nurtured a strong love of the arts in both of us.  It feels as though we have come full circle.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/liberal-arts1.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="liberal-arts1" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Raleigh, North Carolina</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to keep the liberal arts alive. It&#8217;s important for those who have extra resources to give. If we don&#8217;t do it, who will?&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how Stephen H. Hulme, who graduated from the UI with a 1974 B.A. degree in classics and a 1980 B.S. degree in computer science, sums up his decision to give generously to the Department of Classics in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p>Hulme&#8217;s pledged gift of $100,000 to endow the Stephen H. Hulme Fund in Classics&#8212;to be used at the discretion of the department&#8217;s chair to help students and faculty with vital educational inititatives&#8212;is very important to the department, as UI budgets become tighter and more and more students enroll in the program.</p>
<p>Hulme, who lives in Raleigh, N.C., with his wife, Gloria, and works as a Program Manager for Sun Microsystems, credits the rhetorical skills and mental discipline he acquired in the Department of Classics for his career success.</p>
<p>Hulme says that in recent visits to the department, he has been impressed by its dynamism, noting the world-class faculty and a solid student body. There are about 30 classics majors today as opposed to just 5 when he was an undergraduate.</p>
<p>Wanting to keep that momentum going, Hulme decided that it was time to give back to the school that had given him so much. He&#8217;s answered the call in exemplary fashion&#8212;and generations of UI classics students will benefit from his selflessness and vision.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/hubel.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="hubel" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>North Liberty, Iowa</p>
<p>For Kenn and Jan Hubel, it&#8217;s really quite simple.</p>
<p>&#8220;We intend to support legacies for outstanding colleagues by contributing to professorship funds named in their honor,&#8221; says Kenn, a professor emeritus in the Department of Internal Medicine of the UI Roy J. and Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine.</p>
<p>To do just that, the Hubels, of North Liberty, Iowa, have made gifts through The University of Iowa Foundation to honor three friends with whom Kenn taught and practiced medicine: James A. Clifton, M.D.; Edward E. Mason, M.D.; and the late Richard D. Williams, M.D.</p>
<p>Clifton established the Gastroenterology and Hepatology Division of the UI Department of Internal Medicine in 1957 and recruited Kenn to the faculty in 1962. Later chair of the Department of Internal Medicine and dean of the medical school, Clifton also was president of several national medical organizations. The Hubels made a generous gift to support the <strong>James A. Clifton Chair in Gastroenterology.</strong></p>
<p>Kenn came to know Mason through their common interests in patient care and research and is a &#8220;great admirer&#8221; of this pioneer in the surgery to reduce obesity. When Mason&#8217;s family, friends, and colleagues started an initiative to endow the <strong>Dr. Edward and Dordanna Mason Professorship</strong>, the Hubels responded with a significant contribution.</p>
<p>Williams, who died in 2010, was an honored investigator, Kenn&#8217;s urologist and friend, and the longtime chair of the Department of Urology. To honor his memory and to support the <strong>Richard D. Williams, M.D., Faculty Fellowship</strong>, the Hubels created a <strong>charitable gift annuity</strong>— a simple contract where in exchange for a gift to the UI Foundation, the Hubels receive guaranteed quarterly payments for life at impressive interest rates. &#8220;We were attracted by this arrangement that provides financial benefits to the giver as well as the recipient,&#8221; Kenn explains.</p>
<p>For Kenn and Jan, these commitments have special significance because in addition to honoring outstanding colleagues, they support the work to which these friends dedicated their lives. </p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very aware of the reduction in financial support to the UI Carver College of Medicine and its faculty from outside sources,&#8221; Kenn says. &#8220;To retain our ability to attract outstanding faculty we have to replace those funds from other sources. These gifts are our small contribution. Many others are needed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bellevue, Iowa</p>
<p>When a brush fire on Ron Hoxmeier&#8217;s eastern Iowa timber farm got out of hand, he was severely burned on his face and hands. After receiving initial care at his local hospital, Hoxmeier&#8212;a retired research scientist with Shell Development Company who lives near Bellevue, Iowa&#8212;transferred to the Burn Treatment Center at University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics for leading-edge burn care and pain management. </p>
<p>Today Hoxmeier&#8217;s scars are minimal, and the pain from his burns is a fading memory. But he&#8217;ll never forget the excellent care he received in the Burn Treatment Center. In appreciation, in 2006 he made a gift that created the <strong>Ronald J. Hoxmeier Miracle Worker Fund</strong> to support continuing-education opportunities for nurses and staff in the unit and the department&#8217;s ongoing research. </p>
<p>Hoxmeier has been pleased with the initial results of his philanthropy, so he has arranged for an estate gift by designating a significant portion of his retirement-plan assets to support the Miracle Worker Fund and to establish the <strong>Dr. Ron Hoxmeier Research Award Fund</strong>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The doctors and nurses here have given me far more than I&#8217;ll ever be able to repay,&#8221; Hoxmeier says about the Burn Treatment Center at UI Hospitals and Clinics. &#8220;I call them my miracle workers. And I wanted to help them because they helped me.&#8221;</p>

		<description><![CDATA["I think it’s important to help out the University."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/hockridge.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="Bob and Annalee Hockridge" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Davenport, Iowa</p>
<p><strong>Robert “Bob” and Annalee “Jake” Hockridge</strong> of Davenport, Iowa, have been fans of Iowa Hawkeye wrestling for a long time—since former Head Coach Dan Gable was just an assistant. Their passion for the team has stayed strong ever since, as evidenced by the <strong>Robert G. and Annalee Hockridge Wrestling Scholarship</strong>, which they endowed with a gift to The University of Iowa Foundation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We also follow football and basketball, but Jake and I like that wrestling is an individual sport,&#8221; Bob says. </p>
<p>Besides that, Bob says, Jake has a special understanding with Head Coach Tom Brands. &#8220;If he doesn’t do well, he knows she’ll come up and straighten him out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fortunately—thanks in large part to loyal fans like the Hockridges who provide crucial scholarship support—Jake hasn’t had to follow through on her promise.</p>
<p>The Hockridges aren’t just fans of UI athletics, but of the entire University of Iowa. Bob, who retired as executive vice president of finance for Brammer Manufacturing in Davenport, graduated from Iowa with a degree in accounting in 1942, after helping teach classes while still a student. Jake earned a B.A. degree from what is now the University of Northern Iowa in 1947, and taught kindergarten before raising and teaching her own children. Bob and Jake have made contributions to support various areas of the UI for more than 45 consecutive years.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it’s important to help out the University,&#8221; Bob says, noting that many in his family are members of The University of Iowa Presidents Club, which recognizes the UI’s most generous contributors.</p>
<p>In particular, Bob and Jake believe it’s important to support the Hawkeyes, and encourage others to do so as well. </p>
<p>&#8220;It helps the program and it gives somebody an opportunity to get through school,&#8221; Jake points out. &#8220;We want to help keep Iowa Wrestling at the top.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks to Bob and Jake’s equal passion and generosity, there will be many future Hawkeye wrestlers not just getting through school, but doing so as champions.</p>

		<description><![CDATA["I've been fortunate to have many good opportunities in my life, thanks, in part, to my education at The University of Iowa."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/hershberger.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="hershberger" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Iowa City, Iowa</p>
<p>More than once in his life, Larry D. Hershberger (66 BBA) has accepted an offer he just couldn&#8217;t refuse.</p>
<p>That explains how this Iowa native and former Marine officer became a senior vice president at TIAA-CREF in New York and, more recently, director of the University of Iowa&#8217;s new <a href="http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/insurance/">Emmett J. Vaughan Institute of Risk Management and Insurance</a>. </p>
<p>It also explains why Hershberger decided to make a similar &#8220;offer&#8221; to notable University of Iowa faculty by establishing the Hershberger Faculty Fellowship in the Henry B. Tippie College of Business.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been fortunate to have many good opportunities in my life, thanks, in part, to my education at The University of Iowa,&#8221; says Hershberger. &#8220;I felt a responsibility to help create similar opportunities for others.&#8221; </p>
<p>That&#8217;s why he recently chose to renew his commitment to the Hershberger Faculty Fellowship&#8212;a fund that provides annual awards to a qualified faculty member in the UI Department of Finance&#8212;through The University of Iowa Foundation. His renewal gift will provide five more years of funding to a fellowship he established three years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can have all the students in the world, but without excellent professors in the classroom, little would be accomplished,&#8221; says Hershberger, a loyal contributor to the UI since 1966. &#8220;And with substantial reductions in state funding, more and more support for faculty must come from private sources.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hershberger&#8217;s investment in UI faculty&#8212;and his leadership of the new institute&#8212;will help secure a better future for The University of Iowa and the state.</p>
<p>&#8220;This goes without saying, but any great institution or endeavor needs support,&#8221; Hershberger says. &#8220;You must be willing to dedicate yourself to worthy causes when you have the opportunity to do so.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was fortunate to be able to attend the University and receive my degree, and since that time, I&#8217;ve felt a responsibility to return the favor.&#8221;</p>

		<description><![CDATA["Because the UI helped  shape who I am today, I want to help shape what the UI will be tomorrow."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/hennessy.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="hennessy" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</p>
<p>When you really love a place, it becomes a part of you. </p>
<p>For Colin Hennessy, who was born in Vermont and raised on the East Coast, it came as a bit of a surprise that the University of Iowa would play such an important—and beloved—role in his life. </p>
<p>When Hennessy was shopping around for the best college for his education dollars, he was &quot;stunned to discover that such a powerhouse of higher education could be found in Iowa.&quot; He enrolled at the university in 1998—and it was the beginning of a beautiful friendship. </p>
<p>Hennessy earned a B.A. degree in communication studies at Iowa in 2001 and then got his master&#8217;s degree in public administration from Iowa State University before returning to the UI to work as associate director for Annual Giving Programs at the University of Iowa Foundation.</p>
<p>It was what he learned in this role that prompted him to eventually elevate his own UI giving beyond just annual donations to a generous bequest that would support two of the areas closest to his heart: philanthropy and the performing arts. </p>
<p>Though Hennessy now is executive director of The Penn Fund at the University of Pennsylvania, he decided, in 2009, to make this planned gift and split it between the UI&#8217;s Philanthropic Studies Program and its Department of Dance.</p>
<p>&quot;Catherine McCulley once said, &#8216;Very little good can be accomplished, or evil avoided, without money,&#8217; and I take that quote as a call to action,&quot; said Hennessy. &quot;You want to change the world? That&#8217;s wonderful. But changing the world takes money.&quot;</p>
<p>By designating the UI Foundation as a beneficiary of his retirement plan, Hennessy will help change the world—and also will help two UI programs change students&#8217; lives far into the future.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe Iowa will graduate the next generation of great thinkers who will advance the worlds of culture and philanthropy in a way that will make the world better, and I want my philanthropic support to help them change the world,&quot; said Hennessy.</p>
<p>His visionary bequest qualified him for membership in the Presidents Club, which recognizes the university&#8217;s most generous contributors, but at just 30 years old—and working as a fundraiser for an institute of higher education—he doesn&#8217;t fit the typical profile of a major donor. That&#8217;s exactly what Hennessy wants people to know about this kind of giving: It&#8217;s easier than it seems.</p>
<p>&quot;As a young graduate, I understand that it can be intimidating to make such a long-term commitment. However, the UI helped shape who I am today, and I want to help shape what the UI will be tomorrow.&quot;</p>

		<description><![CDATA["The student-athletes are some of the finest young people I've ever met. I'm very pleased to help them."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/heineking.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="heineking" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Iowa City, Iowa</p>
<p>Don Heineking&#8217;s life has been enriched by his love for the Hawkeyes. Now his extraordinary generosity means that scores of talented, hardworking student-athletes can reach for success at Iowa, both in the classrooms and on the fields. And the mats. And the courts. And the tracks. And the diamonds &#8230;</p>
<p>Heineking, of Iowa City, has given $1 million to The University of Iowa Foundation over a period of several years to establish the <strong>Donald W. and Marilyn Heineking Scholarships for UI student-athletes in eight sports</strong>. Marilyn Heineking, an avid Hawkeye fan in her own right, died in 2004.</p>
<p>The Heinekings’ gift established endowed scholarships for Iowa Hawkeye student-athletes on the UI football, women’s basketball, wrestling, softball, baseball, volleyball, and men’s cross country teams, as well as one for a student manager on the men’s basketball squad.</p>
<p>No scholarship gift has touched more individual sports at the UI, and the volleyball and cross country scholarships are the first for those teams.</p>
<p>UI Director of Intercollegiate Athletics Robert A. Bowlsby said the gift is unique in its scope and <strong>offers crucial stability to the entire athletics program</strong>. He pointed out that when the UI athletics department offers full scholarships to student-athletes, the tuition and other associated costs such as room and board, books, and fees are paid in full by the department to the UI.</p>
<p>&#8220;Scholarships are by far the single largest expense the department incurs, and the costs increase annually,&#8221; Bowlsby said, &#8220;so to have these scholarships endowed is an extraordinary asset. Don Heineking has given to generations of UI student-athletes, both men and women in a wide variety of programs, the opportunity to earn a UI education and compete for the Hawkeyes. We couldn&#8217;t be more grateful for his generosity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Larry Wieczorek, head coach of the men&#8217;s cross country and track and field teams, echoed Bowlsby&#8217;s gratitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don Heineking&#8217;s gift will inspire many future runners on our team,&#8221; Wieczorek said. &#8220;His gift is a wonderful vote of confidence in our program and Olympic sports at Iowa.&#8221;</p>
<p>Heineking, who graduated from the UI in 1958 with a B.S.C. degree in commerce and science, said he was motivated to establish the scholarships by his <strong>respect for the UI athletics program and the student-athletes who participate in it</strong>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone involved with UI athletics does a great job,&#8221; Heineking said. &#8220;The student-athletes are some of the finest young people I&#8217;ve ever met. They&#8217;re polite, articulate and energetic, and reflect the values and integrity of the Hawkeye athletics program. It takes a lot of discipline for any student to get through college in good standing, and for student-athletes to do so with the demands placed on them is remarkable. I&#8217;m very pleased to help them and the Iowa athletics program.&#8221;</p>
<p>Heineking is a native of rural Latimer, Iowa. He and Marilyn Sorensen, also of Latimer, married in 1957, while he was a UI student. After graduating from the UI, Heineking served in the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps and also served in the Army Reserve, retiring as a captain. At the age of 26, in 1962, he purchased a controlling interest in Security State Bank in Hubbard, Iowa, of which he still serves as chairman of the board of directors.</p>
<p>Marilyn Heineking worked as a teacher and a homemaker. Together, they raised three children: Kristin Barrash of Iowa City, Lisa Heineking of Walnut Creek, Calif., and Mark Heineking of Iowa City. The Heinekings moved in 1998 from Hubbard to Iowa City, where Marilyn Heineking died after a lengthy illness in February 2004.</p>
<p>The Heinekings were active volunteers and major contributors for many community initiatives in Hubbard, including the Hubbard Nursing Home and the Hubbard Community Fund. Don Heineking was town treasurer of Hubbard, and he has been a leader in statewide banking associations, in addition to serving on the board of directors of the Johnson County I-Club, the National I-Club, and the Iowa Scholarship Fund.</p>
<p>With his all-encompassing gift, Don Heineking has established a <strong>far-reaching Hawkeye legacy</strong>&#8212;by helping generations of student-athletes make Hawkeye history.</p>

<p>For Janet Hawkins, using her financial resources while she was living to guarantee income for the rest of her life&#8212;and then to help create educational opportunities for young people&#8212;was just the way things ought to be. </p>
<p>That was more than just a saying&#8212;it was a prophecy of sorts, left behind by Janet&#8217;s father, that has come true.</p>
<p>Her father, Samuel Johnston, graduated from the UI College of Dentistry in 1918 and practiced in Oskaloosa, Iowa. In 1925, when Janet was just four years old, he died during surgery at the UI.</p>
<p>Janet, who died in 2006, never really knew her dad, but she held on to some things from his dental office, including a Billiken&#8212;a clay figurine popular in the early 20th century that represented &#8220;the god of things as they ought to be.&#8221; </p>
<p>One day, Janet asked Bill Windauer, the director of development for the UI College of Dentistry, if he might want the Billiken and other memorabilia from her dad&#8217;s office. They struck up a friendship, and Janet went on to honor her father&#8217;s memory in an especially significant way&#8212;by creating the Dr. Samuel Johnston Dental Scholarship and the Dr. Samuel Johnston Student Fellowship. </p>
<p>Janet created this Iowa legacy through The University of Iowa Foundation using a <a href="http://www.gftpln.org/stelterweb/CategoryDetailList.do?orgId=158&#038;categoryId=228">charitable gift annuity</a> (CGA). Through this simple contract with the UI Foundation, Janet enjoyed guaranteed payments for the rest of her life, as well as tax advantages when she made the gift.</p>
<p>&#8220;It gives me a wonderful peace of mind,&#8221; Janet said then, &#8220;to remember my father this way and to be sure that my estate will be used in a way I believe in.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Janet died, the Johnston Scholarship went into effect. During the 2008-2009 school year, UI dental student Jamie Gross (Class of 2009) received the scholarship, and expressed her thanks for Janet&#8217;s generosity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very grateful,&#8221; Jamie said. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to make ends meet when you&#8217;re in dental school, and you can&#8217;t have a job because you&#8217;re so busy.&#8221; </p>
<p>Jamie, who never met Janet, will go on to practice dentistry in a small town near her home town of Sheldon, Iowa&#8212;bringing the memory of another small-town Iowa dentist, Samuel Johnston, full circle.</p>
<p>No one will ever know for sure whether it&#8217;s because of her father&#8217;s Billiken that things worked out so well for Janet in passing on her legacy to Jamie, but one thing is for sure &#8212;for Janet, Jamie, and the many other students who will benefit from Janet&#8217;s generosity, this is clearly as things ought to be.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/athletics1.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="athletics" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Ottumwa, Iowa</p>
<p>Making a planned gift to The University of Iowa Foundation does more than secure crucial funds for The University of Iowa. It gives donors the opportunity to ensure that their most heartfelt passions can be advanced through sound financial planning.</p>
<p>Carol Haupert of Ottumwa, Iowa, is just one example. After graduating from the UI in 1978 with a B.S. degree in elementary education, she taught in western Iowa for 13 years. During that time, she also coached high school girls basketball and softball.</p>
<p>Haupert has seen firsthand the ways that participation in athletics can contribute to academic success. And by creating an athletic scholarship at the UI, she&#8217;s doing what she can on a personal level to help advance these two important aspects of her life.</p>
<p>&quot;My entire adult life has been dedicated to education and athletics,&quot; explained Haupert, a die-hard Iowa Hawkeye fan who now works as a public education and teachers&#8217; advocate. &quot;<strong>Establishing this scholarship is a perfect marriage of the two things I value most.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>In order to achieve her dream of helping UI student-athletes reach their educational goals, Haupert worked with members of the UI Foundation&#8217;s planned giving and athletic development staffs. With their assistance, she established a revocable living trust and arranged for some of her retirement assets to one day be used to create a named, endowed, full-ride football scholarship.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s wonderful to feel assured that no matter what happens to me, my retirement funds will be used in a meaningful and significant way,&quot; Haupert said.</p>
<p>However, Haupert wanted to make a difference right away as well. Because she&#8217;s unable to create a full-ride football scholarship until her trust and retirement assets can be transferred to the UI upon her death, she arranged to build on her consistent annual giving to the I-Club with a larger immediate gift so that a named, endowed athletic scholarship could be awarded beginning in the fall of 2004.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;ve never been so thrilled and proud to write a check,&quot; she said. &quot;<strong>Instead of having an object that will just fade away, I have the honor of really helping someone.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>No matter your life&#8217;s passion, The University of Iowa is likely to offer a way to enrich it. And planned giving through the UI Foundation can be your avenue to creatively helping you pass it on to future generations.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/cancer.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Columbus, Indiana</p>
<p>It was going to be a new beginning for <strong>Earl and Thelma Hatfield</strong>. </p>
<p>After 20 years of working for John Deere in Moline, Illinois, Earl retired on February 1, 2000—and Thelma was slated to retire from her teaching position at Scott Community College in Davenport at the end of that school year. </p>
<p>Just a few days into February, though, the Hatfields received terrible news. After she’d been feeling weak and short of energy, Thelma had consulted with a local physician and learned she had terminal cancer, with, most likely, from one month to 18 months to live. Suddenly their life went from one of dreaming about their retirement together to one of managing Thelma’s illness, working and praying to have as much time together as possible.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Hatfields were referred to University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. There, they were put under the care of <strong>Frederick Johlin, Jr., M.D.</strong>, a specialist in the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology in the Department of Internal Medicine, who was assisted by Mary Panther, a clinical-specialist nurse. </p>
<p>&quot;Dr. Johlin was just so fantastic,&quot; remembers Earl, who now lives in Columbus, Indiana. &quot;They’d jump out of bed in the middle of the night, when Thelma’s condition would worsen, to provide an examination or procedure. It seemed to be just a common part of Dr. Johlin and Mary’s lives. They are such professionals .&quot; </p>
<p>Thelma died almost two years later, on Valentine’s Day, having had months more time with Earl than had been forecast. Earl was so grateful for the expert care and steadfast attention Thelma had received from Johlin, he knew right away that one day he wanted to do something to help Johlin and his colleagues fight cancer. </p>
<p>Earl has included a substantial charitable bequest in his estate plans to enhance the endowed <strong>Frederick Johlin Research Fund</strong>. Earl likes knowing that his wishes will be carried out after he’s gone—and that while still living, his bequest can easily be changed to meet his and his family’s evolving and ongoing needs.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope the fund helps make life better for future patients, or better yet, helps find a cure for cancer,&quot; says Earl. &quot;I want it to be used however Dr. Johlin thinks would be best.&quot; </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/hartwig.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="hartwig" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Iowa City, Iowa</p>
<p>Through her generous contributions to the University of Iowa College of Nursing and her longtime association with UI Hospitals and Clinics, Sally Mathis Hartwig has left an indelible mark on the University and the local community.</p>
<p>A native of Dayton, Iowa, Sally earned a B.S.N. degree from the UI in 1975 and a master&#8217;s degree in nursing administration in 1977. She served as director of nursing at UI Hospitals and Clinics from 1979 to 1993 and again, on an interim basis, in 1998.</p>
<p>Sally recently contributed $50,000 to the UI Foundation to establish the <strong>Sally Mathis Hartwig Scholarship</strong>. The scholarship will be awarded annually to two nurses currently employed by UI Hospitals and Clinics who demonstrate excellent clinical skills and leadership potential, and are seeking an advanced degree through the College of Nursing. </p>
<p>In 1999, Sally’s colleagues and associates established the Sally Mathis Hartwig Professorship in Gerontological Nursing Research to recognize her important contributions and to honor her extensive career. Sally made a significant gift to the professorship initiative, and has been a loyal financial supporter of the University in other areas as well. </p>
<p>For years, Sally has tirelessly served the nursing profession with the same compassion and care she provided her patients. And generations of students and faculty in the College of Nursing—and nurses at UI Hospitals and Clinics—will benefit from her generosity and commitment.</p>

		<description><![CDATA["We are proud to share our financial resources to make sure that a UI student can become a physician."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/athletics1.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="athletics" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Davenport, Iowa</p>
<p>Sally and Joe Harper, of Davenport, Iowa, have two lifelong passions: a desire to make the world a better place and a love for the Iowa Hawkeyes.</p>
<p>Through their generous gifts supporting medicine and scholarship at the University of Iowa, they’ve brought the two together in ways that will have far-reaching impact.</p>
<p>University of Iowa athletics have brought enormous joy to the Harpers’ lives. Sally, who grew up with avid Hawkeye fans as parents, has missed only a handful of home Iowa football games in her life, and when she and Joe married in 1964, she quickly whipped Joe into shape as a Hawkeye fan.</p>
<p>But the Harpers’ love for the university extends far beyond athletics—the UI academic medical center has helped enrich and lengthen their time together. After having heart procedures at Genesis Health System in Davenport, Joe enrolled in several experimental medical programs at University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics and is enjoying a healthier life as a result.</p>
<p>Initially, the Harpers had concentrated their scholarship support in Hawkeye Athletics, but Joe’s heart problems—and the excellent medical care he received—made them turn their attention to supporting medicine at Iowa as well. The dedication and knowledge of the doctors, nurses, and rehabilitative staff during Joe’s hospital care have impressed upon the Harpers the importance of “paying it forward” by supporting UI Health Care.</p>
<p>The Harpers also recently took advantage of the <a href="http://www.gftpln.org/Article.do?orgId=158&amp;articleId=14712&amp;featured=true">charitable IRA rollover</a>, and made an outright gift to support the construction of the new University of Iowa Children’s Hospital.</p>
<p>“Though we never had children of our own, we share a passion for helping young people.” Sally said.</p>
<p>And of course, their recent gift is just one of the many ways they’re doing that. In appreciation for all that the UI has offered them during their lives, the Harpers have established bequests creating numerous medical and athletic scholarships in their estate plans, working closely with their attorney and University of Iowa Foundation staff members. They also created a scholarship fund in the Roy J. and Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine that is already helping current medical students.</p>
<p>“We are proud to share our financial resources to make sure that a UI medical student can achieve his or her goal to become a physician, and we take comfort in knowing the recipient will go on to improve and save countless lives.”</p>
<p>Through more than four decades together, the Harpers have worked hard. Joe retired from Caterpillar Tractor after 25 years and then signed on at Group O Companies in Milan, Illinois, where he is senior vice president. Sally retired from Deere &amp; Company after 24 years, and among other activities the couple enjoys raising funds for Care for Kids in the Quad Cities, an event that supports UI Children’s Hospital.</p>
<p>Thanks to UI Hospitals and Clinics and the Iowa Hawkeyes, they’re still having fun and enjoying life. Throughout their years together, they have strived to always leave things better than they found them. And through their generous support, they’re ensuring that the fruits of their hard work will continue to benefit University of Iowa students, patients, and fans for generations to come.</p>

		<description><![CDATA["The engineers with good communication skills stand out among their peers."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/hanson.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="hanson" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Hinsdale, Illinois</p>
<p>Technically speaking, Tom Hanson (1960 B.S.M.E.) didn&#8217;t spend most of his professional life as an engineer. Rather, he used his UI engineering degree to develop a career based on speaking technically. </p>
<p>After years in the heating and cooling industry, Hanson integrated his expertise in engineering, business, sales, and communications and started his own company in 1980, which is now known as Fleming Hanson Sales. The Chicago-based company, from which Hanson retired in 2000, contracts with various heating and cooling manufacturers as exclusive regional sales representatives.</p>
<p>Now, inspired by his own career experiences and a deep commitment to his alma mater, Hanson and his wife, Nancy, have endowed the Hanson Center for Technical Communication in the UI College of Engineering. Through this innovative center, today&#8217;s students have a comprehensive resource for developing excellent communication skills as part of their engineering education&#8212;skills Hanson feels are too often missing among engineers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I learned during my career that there is a wide range of ability among engineers to speak and write effectively, and that the engineers with good communication skills stand out among their peers,&#8221; said Hanson, who lives in Hinsdale, Illinois. &#8220;They are better engineers, and they have broader career opportunities.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom and Nancy have been very supportive of the college and the University for many years,&#8221; said P. Barry Butler, dean of the College of Engineering. &#8220;In addition to endowing the Center for Technical Communication, they have made generous contributions in support of the Seamans Center for the Engineering Arts and Sciences, the C. Maxwell Stanley Hydraulics Laboratory, and the annual Engineering Excellence Fund.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as important,&#8221; Butler added, &#8220;Tom has played a leadership role in chairing the college&#8217;s Development Council and as a key member of the Comprehensive Campaign Steering Committee, which directs our efforts within the University&#8217;s <a href="/campaign/"><em>Good. Better. Best. Iowa</em> campaign.</a> We couldn&#8217;t be more grateful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, as UI engineering students develop essential oral and written communication skills&#8212;a longstanding emphasis throughout the UI&#8212;through courses, peer tutoring, and other programs in the Hanson Center for Technical Communication, they will benefit not only from the Hansons&#8217; generosity, but from the lessons Tom Hanson learned over a long and wide-ranging career.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s no mere technicality.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/gruneich.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="gruneich" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Park City, Utah</p>
<p>Kevin Gruneich (1980 B.B.A.) didn&#8217;t have any big advantages growing up as a middle-class kid in Montezuma, Iowa. The son of a Presbyterian minister and a part-time secretary/homemaker, Kevin paid his own way through college at the UI, having begun working and saving as early as grade school. But he didn&#8217;t do it alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;If not for scholarships, grants, and loans bridging the funding shortfall, I may not have gotten to the finish line,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I had some obstacles to overcome but they were modest compared to the obstacles other students face&#8212;especially minority and first-generation college students.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Kevin now gives generously to support students from underrepresented minority groups at The University of Iowa. In addition to creating the Kevin Gruneich Opportunity at Iowa Scholarship Fund, he is also underwriting The Iowa Edge, a new program that strives to provide orientation, programming, community-building, and counseling support for minority and first-generation college students new to the UI.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am just beginning to return the investment others have made in me,&#8221; he explains, and he hopes that his philanthropy will multiply with future generations. &#8220;I believe the students I help will eventually also be there to help others, creating a virtuous cycle that will improve the University, the state, and society as a whole.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an ambitious view of the future, but that kind of outlook is nothing new for this successful alumnus. After earning his bachelor&#8217;s degree in finance and industrial relations from the UI, he went on to earn an M.B.A. degree in finance from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, and was recognized as one of the top publishing analysts in the world during his 22-year Wall Street career. </p>
<p>Now semi-retired in Park City, Utah, Gruneich remains involved in private business ventures and manages his family&#8217;s investment portfolio. With his wife, Donna, he also administers The Kevin and Donna Gruneich Charitable Foundation, supporting philanthropic causes with a focus on education, religion, environmental protection, and helping the underprivileged.</p>
<p>For Kevin, there&#8217;s something special about young people just getting started in their lives and careers. &#8220;The undergraduate years are so important,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;What one experiences, learns, and practices during college, along with the momentum coming out of this period, is key to attaining life goals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks to scholarships provided with the help of friends like Kevin Gruneich, deserving UI students will have no trouble building up speed toward reaching those goals.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/gerdin2012.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="gerdin2012" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Solon, Iowa</p>
<p>For three decades, the Gerdin family of Solon, Iowa, have been extraordinarily generous friends of the University of Iowa. Now the family has extended their legacy of philanthropy with a $12 million gift commitment to the University of Iowa to support the new UI Children’s Hospital. The gift, from the Gerdin Family Foundation, is the largest to date for the Children’s Hospital&#8217;s $50 million building campaign. In recognition of this contribution, the lobby and children’s theater in the new hospital will be named for the Gerdin family.</p>
<p>UI President Sally Mason announced the gift during a special event at UI Hospitals and Clinics on Friday, October 19, 2012. Joining President Mason were members of the Gerdin family, UI Health Care Vice President for Medical Affairs Jean Robillard, and UI Foundation President and CEO Lynette Marshall.</p>
<p>“This visionary and transformative gift from the Gerdin family will help us create a truly special environment for health care—one in which our nationally recognized faculty, staff, and programs can better meet the current and future needs of Iowa’s children and their families,” says Robillard. “The new facility is essential to building a true statewide system of care.”</p>
<p>Currently, care and services provided by UI Children’s Hospital are spread throughout the larger UI Hospitals and Clinics complex. However, providing care and treatment for infants and children often requires specialized facilities. In addition, the needs of Iowa’s youngest patients are growing beyond the capacities of the university’s hospital.</p>
<p>When it is completed in 2016, the new hospital will be a 14-story, 195-bed facility specifically designed to meet the health-care needs of children and their families. The 480,000-square-foot building will be located north of the Pomerantz Family Pavilion on Hawkins Drive, adjacent and linked to UI Hospitals and Clinics.</p>
<p>“The Gerdin family once again has demonstrated an extraordinary level of generosity and commitment to the University of Iowa,” says President Mason. “We certainly are fortunate to have friends and community leaders such as the Gerdins, who share our vision and priorities.”</p>
<p>The Gerdin family previously made the largest athletic scholarship gift in University history: a $5 million commitment to the UI Foundation to establish the Russ and Ann Gerdin Family Athletic Scholarship Fund, which will provide multiple scholarships each year for student-athletes in football, men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s basketball, wrestling, and other men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s sports on a rotating basis.</p>
<p>The family also has made gifts to the UI to fund the Russell A. and Ann Gerdin Athletic Learning Center, the UI Athletics Hall of Fame and Visitors Center, the J. Hayden Fry Center for Prostate Cancer Research, athletic scholarships, and the renovation of Kinnick Stadium. And they have supported the Russell and Ann Gerdin American Cancer Society Hope Lodge in Iowa City.</p>
<p>“Our family is proud to continue to support the University of Iowa community,” says Mike Gerdin, president and chief executive officer of North Liberty-based Heartland Express Inc. “Nothing is more important than the health of a child, and we’re looking forward to seeing the development of this new, state-of-the-art facility dedicated to delivering the best health care available to the children of Iowa and the nation.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/geer.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="geer" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Albuquerque, New Mexico</p>
<p>Dennis Geer (1966 B.B.A.) hasn’t lived in Iowa since he graduated from The University of Iowa in 1966. Born and raised on a farm near Clarinda, Iowa—which he jokingly refers to as “the Big C”—Dennis lived and worked in Washington, D.C., for more than 30 years with his wife, Bonnie, a native of Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p>
<p>Still, Dennis says, &#8220;All those years in D.C., everyone knew me as &#8216;that guy from Iowa.&#8217; And I have always been proud of that. It&#8217;s my roots.&#8221;</p>
<p>When it came time to decide how their estate would be distributed, the Geers agreed that each of them would determine where half of the money would go. Dennis knew immediately that he would leave his portion of their estate to the UI, including the Henry B. Tippie College of Business, in which he earned his degree in marketing.</p>
<p>&#8220;My degree helped stabilize me. It gave me solid footing that opened up a lot of opportunities for success,&#8221; Dennis explains. &#8220;For a farm kid whose dad had just a ninth-grade education, my UI education changed my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bonnie met Dennis—&#8221;that guy from Iowa&#8221;—who was then a recent grad who had been drafted into military service and was stationed in Albuquerque. They were married and moved to Washington, D.C., where Dennis worked as a highlevel executive in a number of federal agencies, including as chief operating officer of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, before joining with GMAC Residential as the company’s chief administrative officer. Bonnie taught high-school English, then worked as a school-system administrator and a high-school principal. Now retired (semiretired, in Dennis&#8217; case; he still does consulting work for ALLY Financial, Inc., and serves on the board of directors for ALLY Bank), the Geers divide their time between Albuquerque and Sarasota, Florida.</p>
<p>Bonnie considered giving her half of the estate to her own alma mater, the University of New Mexico. But when it came down to it, her connection with the UI was stronger. &#8220;I really can&#8217;t explain why,&#8221; says Bonnie, who never lived in Iowa herself. &#8220;But to me, going to Iowa is like going home.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Geers&#8217; estate will be distributed across numerous disciplines at the University. A portion will provide general, unrestricted support for the business school through the <strong>Tippie College of Business Excellence Fund</strong>. Other generous gifts from the estate will establish the UI-wide <strong>Dennis F. and Bonnie J. Geer Scholarship Fund</strong> to assist undergraduate students, especially those from rural southwest Iowa communities; the <strong>Bonnie J. and Dennis F. Geer Education Scholarship Fund</strong> to assist aspiring teachers in the College of Education; and the <strong>Bonnie J. and Dennis F. Geer Research Fund for Pediatric Medicine</strong> in University of Iowa Children&#8217;s Hospital.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a remarkable level of generosity—especially for a couple who have spent most of their lives geographically far from the UI.</p>
<p>&#8220;We love kids, though we don&#8217;t have children of our own,&#8221; Bonnie says. &#8220;We wanted our estate to help young people achieve their full potential— and truly, there are bright and talented kids everywhere who need support. Because Iowa has meant so much to us, we decided to reach out to kids in Iowa, through the University, and help open up the world to them.&#8221;</p>

		<description><![CDATA["It's almost selfish because it feels so good to be able to empower someone else’s dreams."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/frederick.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="frederick" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Santa Monica, California</p>
<p>Tanna Frederick (1999 B.A.) was bitten by the acting bug as a nine-year-old in Mason City, Iowa, and she&#8217;s never looked back. She began performing in Mason City&#8217;s Stebens Children&#8217;s Theater around the age of nine—doing four or five shows a year—and got involved with choir and community theatre at every opportunity as a teenager.</p>
<p>If she&#8217;d have had her way, Tanna would have moved to Hollywood right after high-school graduation to chase her dream of being a professional actor. But her parents—David, a pharmacist, and Nancy, a nursing instructor—insisted that she go to college and, being of modest means, they also thought it was a good idea for Tanna to pay her own way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Iowa offered me a scholarship that paid my tuition, so I didn&#8217;t have to worry about anything but my grades,&#8221; Tanna said. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to afford college without that assistance—but it was more than that. I felt it was a message saying, &#8216;You can do it. We believe in you.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>She did it—and with flying colors. She majored in theatre arts and political science, performed in numerous productions in UI theatres, graduated Phi Beta Kappa, and was both UI Homecoming Queen and valedictorian of her graduating class.</p>
<p>Tanna has beaten the odds in Hollywood, starring in four films by influential independent-film director Henry Jaglom as well as playing the title character in A. R. Gurney&#8217;s hit play <em>Sylvia</em>—to rave reviews—at the Edgemar Center Theater in Santa Monica, California. She credits the UI for not only giving her the chops to catch the attention of directors, but also nourishing her independent, experimental approach to theatre and cinema production.</p>
<p>&#8220;The UI is a rich breeding ground for artists,&#8221; Tanna explained. &#8220;We had amazing professors who helped us focus on realizing our artistic vision instead of focusing on what criticism we might draw. At the UI, I learned to look at everything as a success. If I wrote a play and it never saw the stage—hey, I wrote a play!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tanna&#8217;s affection for the UI means that she&#8217;ll do whatever she can to ensure its ongoing vibrancy and excellence. She&#8217;s returned to campus to talk with UI theatre and film students—providing young actors with instruction and encouragement. In 2008, she established an annual scholarship for an incoming theatre student in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences—and in 2011 she increased the funding to provide even more support.</p>
<p>Her enthusiasm is contagious. Henry Jaglom, director of Tanna&#8217;s films, has also established a scholarship of his own at Iowa, annually supporting a female playwriting student.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one of the things I&#8217;m happiest about,&#8221; Tanna said. &#8220;It&#8217;s almost selfish because it feels so good to be able to empower someone else&#8217;s dreams.&#8221;</p>

		<description><![CDATA["Being a member of the Frantz family means being a member of the University of Iowa family."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/frantz.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="frantz" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Northbrook, Illinois</p>
<p>Mike Frantz, an Iowa City native, 1977 UI finance and marketing graduate, and former Hawkeye football player, has made his mark in the business world as an entrepreneur and real estate investor. Mike and his wife, Susan, live in Susan’s hometown of Northbrook, Illinois, while they (along with multiple members of the Frantz family and their company, Network Growth Management) own and manage more than $75 million in commercial real estate across eastern Iowa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our business involves the whole family,&#8221; Mike says. &#8220;It keeps me close to my family as well as strongly connected with Iowa City and my alma mater.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mike and Susan decided to pay tribute to those deep connections—and acknowledge the important role the UI has played in their life together—by making a gift of $300,000 to the University, divided equally among <strong>Iowa football</strong>, the <strong>UI Henry B. Tippie College of Business</strong>, and <strong>UI Children&#8217;s Hospital</strong>.</p>
<p>These three areas may seem like they don’t relate, but they are all tied together by their importance to the Frantz family.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I&#8217;ve grown older, I&#8217;ve realized just how deeply college shaped me &#8211; not just my career, but my personality as well,&#8221; Mike explains. </p>
<p>He credits the Iowa football program with teaching him important lessons about teamwork, loyalty, and leadership while the business school helped him learn to think abstractly and creatively about doing business in the real world. </p>
<p>With their gift, the Frantzes also pay tribute to important family members. Mike&#8217;s mother, Joan, of Iowa City, who is named in the<br />
<strong>Joan A. Frantz</strong> <strong>Fund</strong> to support pediatric oncology research, is a breast cancer survivor who not only was treated for cancer at University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics but also worked for years as a nurse in the UI Department of Pediatrics. Mike&#8217;s father, Jack, who lost his battle with cancer in 1997, is named in the <strong>Jack A. Frantz Excellence Fund for Real Estate</strong> in the Tippie College of Business.</p>
<p>Susan, a Drake University graduate, says, &#8220;Being a member of the Frantz family means being a member of the University of Iowa family. When we realized we are in a position to give back, the UI was at the top of our list.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mike agrees. “The UI Foundation made it easy to match our giving with UI programs that are meaningful to us. It has been a wonderful experience.”</p>

		<description><![CDATA[“For people my age, you can’t find a better way to give to the UI right now. ”]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/frank.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="frank" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Saint Louis, Missouri</p>
<p>When it comes to win-win philanthropic opportunities, Harris Frank of St. Louis, Missouri, advocates for the charitable gift annuity.</p>
<p>“For people my age, you can’t find a better way to give to the UI right now,” says Harris, 86, a longtime Tippie College of Business supporter. “Retirees like myself can do something good for an organization and get something they need for themselves. I am thrilled to be able to do this, and I think other people ought to consider it.” </p>
<p>Harris says that the charitable gift annuity is even better today than when he and his late wife, Judith, made their donation to support the Judith R. Frank Business Communications Center. That’s true, he says, not only because it benefits the University of Iowa, but because it offers a great annual income stream and a tax deduction in the year he and his wife made the gift. </p>
<p>“Interest rates on traditional savings accounts are at all-time lows, so it’s a perfect storm,” Harris says. “The gift annuities offer an attractive, steady income that I couldn’t possibly realize in any other way. Some of that is tax free, so it’s a great deal all around.” </p>
<p>A charitable gift annuity is an irrevocable gift of cash or appreciated securities that the foundation retains until the donors reach the end of their lives. During their lifetimes, the donors receive annuity payments from the UI Foundation based on a fixed percentage of the funding value of the gift. Upon the death of the last annuitant, the remaining funds are used to support the University of Iowa according to the donor’s wishes. Charitable gift annuities can be used for anything, from scholarships and endowments to specific programs. </p>
<p>The annuity rate is determined by the age or ages of the individual donor or couple. Annuity rates are higher for older donors and lower for younger donors. For example, a couple, ages 70 and 72, currently would receive a 4.7 percent annuity rate on a $10,000 gift annuity. They can claim a charitable deduction of $2,656 and they will receive $470 per year, guaranteed for the rest of their lives. </p>
<p>Gift annuity payments also offer favorable taxation opportunities. With cash funding, a portion of the annual payment is taxed as ordinary income and a portion is tax free. With appreciated securities that have been held for more than a year, a portion of the annual payment is taxed as ordinary income, a portion is taxed as capital gain, and a portion may be tax free. </p>
<p>Because it has been beneficial to him, Harris would like more retirees, donors, accountants, and lawyers to learn about the attractive benefits of charitable gift annuities. </p>
<p>“People can support the University of Iowa and greatly enhance their income at the same time,” he says. </p>

		<description><![CDATA["I wanted to give something back. Anything needed to help these graduates get started with their physical therapy career."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/medicine1.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="College of Medicine" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Iowa City, Iowa</p>
<p>She&#8217;s spent most of her life helping patients get a leg up and stand tall as they recover from injuries and surgery. Now, former UI physical therapist Mary Lou Fairchild (1962 P.T.) is doing likewise for UI grads as they embark on the same rewarding career she chose for herself.</p>
<p>Fairchild worked for 39 years as a physical therapist, retiring from her position with UI Back Care in the Department of Orthopedic Surgery in University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in January 2001. She recently made an initial $12,000 gift to the UI Foundation to create the Mary Lou Fairchild Physical Therapy Award Fund.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to give something back,&#8221; she explains. The Fairchild Fund will be used to award $500 each year to a graduate of the Graduate Program in Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Science, on the basis of his or her excellence in clinical work.</p>
<p>The award is meant to be used to help pay back student loans or cover moving expenses&#8212;&#8221;anything needed,&#8221; Mary Lou says, &#8220;to help these graduates get started with their physical therapy career.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead of showering Mary Lou with farewell gifts upon her retirement, friends and coworkers instead&#8212;at her request&#8212;donated money in amounts varying from $5 to more than $100 to the award fund in her name. The fund now stands at nearly $13,300.</p>
<p>The University of Iowa and the Graduate Program in Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Science are extremely grateful to Mary Lou for her creativity and generosity in creating the Fairchild Fund.</p>

		<description><![CDATA["The communications skills I learned as a UI student became the common thread throughout my entire career."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/elmquist.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="elmquist" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Des Moines, Iowa</p>
<p>&#8220;The communications skills I learned as a UI student became the common thread throughout my entire career,&#8221; said UI alumna Marion Elmquist.</p>
<p>That’s why the 1972 graduate of the UI School of Journalism and Mass Communication (J-MC School) in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences decided to give back to the University. Elmquist made a generous pledge to the campaign to help build the Philip D. Adler Journalism and Mass Communication Building. </p>
<p>After completing a B.A. degree at the UI, the Des Moines native moved to Chicago to work in advertising. Along the way, she received master’s degrees in advertising and business administration at Northwestern University in 1975 and 1985. She worked in advertising and publishing for nearly two decades, then returned to Des Moines, although she was involved in running an entrepreneurial business in Denver, which meant a lot of time on the road.</p>
<p>Since 1982, Elmquist has made annual gifts to numerous UI areas, including the J-MC School, Hancher, the UI Museum of Natural History, and the University of Iowa Alumni Association (UIAA). Over the years, the gifts have added up—not only has Elmquist had a powerful impact on the programs she supports, but she has also earned membership in The Presidents Club, which recognizes the UI’s most generous contributors.</p>
<p>Another of Marion’s passions has been her work with Ski for Light, an international program that pairs sighted guides with visually impaired cross-country skiers. Her 14 years as a volunteer with the program have led to many international friendships.</p>
<p>Since retiring from her fast-paced career several years ago, the avid adventurer has traveled much of the world, and commutes frequently between her homes in Des Moines and Vail, where she works part-time as an Alpine ski instructor.</p>
<p>Marion serves on the advisory board of the UI College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, and represents the college as a member of the UIAA Board of Directors.</p>
<p>&#8220;The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences touches nearly every UI student, whatever field they pursue,” said Elmquist. “It’s important to support a liberal arts education, because it teaches students how to learn and creates a sense of curiosity about the rest of the world—music, history, all of the great things that enrich our lives.&#8221;</p>

		<description><![CDATA["I’ve been very blessed and fortunate, and to be able to provide those opportunities to young men and women is a great joy for us."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/devries.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="The Devries Family" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Iowa City, Iowa</p>
<p>&quot;It was a dream come true,&quot; says defensive end <strong>Jared Devries</strong> (1998 B.A.) of the Detroit Lions about playing football for the Iowa Hawkeyes. &quot;You grow up watching and listening to the Hawks, so to have the opportunity presented to you to play for them is like living your childhood dream.&quot;</p>
<p>That chance to play for Head Coach Hayden Fry came in the form of an athletic scholarship that he earned playing at Aplington-Parkersburg (Iowa) High School for his coach and good friend Ed Thomas. Now Jared and his wife, Jamie, want to make sure that future UI student-athletes are able to pursue their own educational and athletic dreams. They’ve established the <strong>DeVries Family Athletic Scholarship</strong> with a generous gift commitment to The University of Iowa Foundation.</p>
<p>&quot;One thing that Jamie and I feel is very important is to give back to the University that provided such an opportunity for us,&quot; Jared, who graduated with a degree in communications, explains. &quot;The Hawkeyes are a big circle, a big family. I’ve been very blessed and fortunate, and to be able to provide those opportunities to young men and women is a great joy for us.&quot;</p>
<p>Jared, of Birmingham, Michigan, is also eager to introduce Hawkeye pride to his sons Jaylen, 9, and Easton, 6. &quot;We’re proud season-ticket holders at Kinnick Stadium,&quot; he says. &quot;We get back as often as we can. The boys just love it.&quot;</p>
<p>Jared holds UI career records for sacks (43) and tackles-for-loss (79), was named first team All-Big Ten for three straight seasons, and was selected as a second team All-American as a junior by Football News. He continues to succeed in the NFL and says that whenever he plays against a former Hawkeye on Sundays, they always make a point of saying hello and catching up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once a Hawk, always a Hawk,&quot; he points out. &quot;It’s a common bond, even if I didn’t play with them at Iowa. No one can ever take the black and gold out of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks to Jared, Jamie, and the DeVries Family Athletic Scholarship, generations of other kids will also grow up to see their Hawkeye dreams come true—dreams that will stick with them for life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/athletics1.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="athletics" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Roseville, California</p>
<p>When Dr. Judith A. Davidson was first recruited to Iowa City in 1978 to become head coach of the University of Iowa field hockey team, she had to look on a map to learn where her new home would be. </p>
<p>She didn&#8217;t know much about Iowa, but she knew plenty about the discipline and commitment it takes to guide a team to its potential&#8212;and by 1986 the Iowa Hawkeye field hockey team had won the NCAA championship.</p>
<p><span class="bodyText"><strong>&#8220;It was the right place and the right time for success,&#8221;</strong></span> Davidson says. &#8220;During my time at Iowa, the women&#8217;s athletics program grew by leaps and bounds under Dr. Christine Grant. We had terrific student-athletes every year. I had such a marvelous experience at Iowa.&#8221;</p>
<p>By the time Davidson moved on in 1988, she had become more convinced than ever of the power of education and of her Hawkeye loyalty. She recently brought those two passions together to endow the Judith Davidson Field Hockey Goalkeeper&#8217;s Scholarship.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are three things a person needs to be to become a great student-athlete, in this order: First, a great human being; second, a good, well-rounded student; and third, a talented and dedicated athlete,&#8221; Davidson, who lives in El Dorado Hills, California, says. &#8220;It makes me very happy to be able to help the UI provide those opportunities.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a long career in collegiate athletics, Davidson is now a financial advisor in Roseville, California&#8212;she notes that she&#8217;s now helping people achieve &#8220;fiscal fitness&#8221; in addition to physical fitness&#8212;so she understands the advantages of using charitable giving as part of her estate planning. </p>
<p>The bequest she&#8217;s established with The University of Iowa Foundation to establish the Davidson Scholarship not only provides her with estate and income tax benefits, but it also provides the peace of mind of knowing that she&#8217;ll be helping young people find success for generations to come.</p>
<p>&#8220;My experience at Iowa helped me achieve more than I ever thought possible,&#8221; Davidson says. &#8220;So <span class="bodyText"><strong>when I no longer need my money, I can help others.</strong></span> That is tremendously satisfying to me.&#8221;</p>

		<description><![CDATA["The regeneration of auditory nerves would be an amazing breakthrough. I get so emotional when I think about it." -John Dane]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/dane.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="dane" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Iowa City, Iowa</p>
<p>Four of John and Allie Dane&#8217;s five children suffer from hearing losses due to genetic auditory nerve problems. Doctors from the <a href="http://www.givetoiowa.org/oto">UI Department of Otolaryngology</a> in the Roy J. and Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine successfully performed a cochlear implant operation for Donna Dane&#8212;who was born profoundly deaf&#8212;partially restoring her hearing.</p>
<p>The Danes, who own Iowa City ice cream institution Dane&#8217;s Dairy Drive-In, wanted to help the UI serve others in need, so they donated 235 acres of Iowa farmland. Forty acres were gifted outright to the UI Foundation. The $115,000 in proceeds from the sale of the land were used to create the John Dane Family Cochlear Implant Research Fund. </p>
<p>The remaining 195 acres were put into a <a href="http://www.gftpln.org/stelterweb/CategoryDetailList.do?orgId=158&amp;categoryId=229">charitable remainder trust</a>, providing steady income for the family and future support for otolaryngological research.</p>
<p>The Danes&#8217; gift supports the pioneering research of Bruce J. Gantz, M.D., head of the Department of Otolaryngology in the <a href="http://www.uifoundation.org/medicine/">UI Carver College of Medicine</a>. Gantz and his team of physicians and scientists have made great strides in stimulating auditory nerve growth and improving hearing through ear implant surgery. </p>
<p>John Dane explained that the work of Gantz and his team had great personal significance to his family and&#8212;combined with the potential impact on millions of people with hearing loss who may eventually benefit from the research taking place at the UI&#8212;inspired the Danes to help out.</p>
<p>&#8220;I vowed that my family would make a significant contribution,&#8221; Dane said. &#8220;The regeneration of auditory nerves, to me, would be an amazing breakthrough. I get so emotional when I think about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gantz said, &#8220;We are thrilled that the Dane family decided to support this research effort. Their gift enables us to advance our research much more quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gantz explained that the gift from the Danes will help UI researchers fund studies to test their new ideas&#8212;such as a recently designed ear implant that, unlike the cochlear, goes just a short way into the inner ear and can greatly improve hearing in those who are not already entirely deaf. </p>
<p>&#8220;Our long-term goal,&#8221; said Gantz, &#8220;is to create a research fund that we can use for the study of auditory nerve regeneration.&#8221;</p>
<p>The UI Foundation works with contributors like the Dane family to turn assets such as real estate into gifts that can support the university.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gifts of farmland can work very well,&#8221; explained David Triplett, the Foundation&#8217;s vice president for <a href="/planned-giving/">gift planning</a>, &#8220;especially when the Foundation has the opportunity to help the donors structure the gift to meet their needs and fulfill their intentions.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/athletics1.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="athletics" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p><img src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/chapman.jpg" alt="Gordon Chapman" width="200" height="250" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-402" align="right" style="padding-left:10px;" />Dallas, Texas</p>
<p>Iowa Hawkeye fans are accustomed to great come-from-behind victories. Every fan has his or her favorite memory of when their heroes in the black and gold used gritty determination to bounce back from seemingly certain defeat to clinch a triumph.</p>
<p>The story of Gordon Chapman, however, must surely rank as <strong>one of the most heroic Hawkeye comebacks of them all</strong>.</p>
<p>In 1951, when Chapman was a junior on the UI tennis team, he was stricken by polio. In those days, polio was a devastating international plague, and contracting the disease almost certainly led to paralysis, if not death.</p>
<p>In true Iowa spirit, though, Chapman refused to succumb. He went on to not just graduate (with a business degree in 1952), but to compete for the Hawkeyes as a senior in the 1952 Big Ten tournament. He and his doubles teammate captured second place—and the hearts of people around the state who were inspired by his courage and conviction.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dad was a wonderful human being,&#8221; says Gordon&#8217;s son, Jeff Chapman (1979 B.B.A.). &#8220;He didn&#8217;t have an enemy in the world. And aside from his family and his faith, what he loved most in the world was The University of Iowa.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon died in 2005 at the age of 75, after a long, active life and a successful insurance career. To honor his father&#8217;s memory, Jeff established the <strong>Gordon Chapman Memorial Athletic Scholarship</strong> through a gift to the UI Foundation.</p>
<p>Knowing that Hawkeye student-athletes will be supported in Gordon&#8217;s name is a great comfort to Jeff, an attorney in Dallas, Texas, and his wife, Sheila (1981 B.S).</p>
<p>&#8220;He was the first in his family to go to college,&#8221; Jeff says of his father. &#8220;He was so proud of his Iowa degree. His favorite place on Earth was Kinnick Stadium. And the best times of my life were in Iowa City with my dad. I&#8217;m very happy to remember him this way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks to Jeff and Sheila, Gordon Chapman will always be there in the black and gold, <strong>urging young people to overcome obstacles and compete with honor</strong>. There could be no finer tribute to this true Iowa ironman.</p>

		<description><![CDATA["Throughout her life’s many roles—board member, businesswoman, mother, wife, and friend—Lucille never lost sight of her passion for helping others."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/carver-lucille.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="carver-lucille" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Muscatine, Iowa</p>
<p>Lucille Avis (Young) Carver was born in a small Iowa town that has a close link to the Mississippi River and an even closer bond among the community’s residents. These strong connections—to both people and place—helped shape Carver’s lifelong passion for supporting education and the environment.</p>
<p>The Muscatine, Iowa, native, who was born on July 27, 1917, and died in her hometown on December 18, 2010, at the age of 93, was well known for her generous philanthropic ventures and her genuine interest in others. Carver and her husband, Roy J. Carver, Sr., whom she married on August 22, 1942, became well-known benefactors through their internationally successful, Muscatine-based businesses.</p>
<p>Their success story began with the Carver Pump Company and evolved into Carver Foundry Products, followed by Bandag, Inc., a tire-retreading company that the Carvers established in 1957. Eventually, the Carver family would sell Bandag, Inc., to Bridgestone Corporation in 2007, and it would become Bridgestone Bandag Tire Solutions.</p>
<p>The Carvers began supporting The University of Iowa—where Lucille had gone to school—in 1969, and she received the University of Iowa Alumni Association’s Distinguished Service Award in 1972. Throughout the years, the couple made very generous contributions to the UI and other community and educational organizations, while also running their family businesses and raising their four boys: Roy J. Carver, Jr.; Martin G. Carver; John A. Carver; and Clayton C. Carver, who died in 1983.</p>
<p>When Roy J. Carver, Sr., died in 1981, his will created the Roy J. Carver Charitable Trust, one of Iowa’s largest private philanthropic foundations, and Lucille served on its board of trustees from 1985 through her retirement in 2002. She also was a former board member of the Carver Pump Company, Carver Foundry Products, and Bandag, Inc., and she served on the University of Iowa Foundation Board of Directors from 1981 to 1985.</p>
<p>Throughout her life’s many roles—board member, businesswoman, mother, wife, and friend—Lucille never lost sight of her passion for helping others. Among her notable giving legacies includes the establishment of the University of Iowa Lucille A. Carver Missisippi Riverside Environmental Research Station at the Fairport Fish Hatchery near Muscatine in 2001. The 7,500-square-foot building is home to hydraulics experts, biologists, geologists, environmental scientists, and students who conduct collaborative research.</p>
<p>In addition, Lucille oversaw, in 2002, the largest gift ever made for the UI at the time in the form of a $63 million commitment from the Carver Charitable Trust to support research, capital advancements, and faculty endowments in the University’s College of Medicine. This gift and other contributions from the trust added up to $90 million in private support and prompted the Board of Regents, State of Iowa, to approve the formal naming of the University of Iowa College of Medicine as the Roy J. and Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine. In 2006, Lucille and other members of her family also attended the dedication of the newly renamed University of Iowa Carver Family Center for Macular Degeneration.</p>
<p>Willard “Sandy” Boyd, president emeritus of The University of Iowa and the longest-serving member on the Carver Charitable Trust Board of Trustees, once said of Lucille: “She was always interested in, and concerned about, the well being of others. She had enormous compassion and warmth.” Throughout her long life, Lucille A. Carver stayed true to those core values and, in doing so, created a legacy as enduring as the Mississippi River itself.</p>

		<description><![CDATA["We made our first gift to Hancher 30 years ago. Since then, we feel our annual gifts have been an excellent investment."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/canter.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="canter" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Iowa City, Iowa</p>
<p>Miriam and Arthur Canter have lived in Iowa City since 1960, moving here (or moving <em>back,</em> since they&#8217;d both been students here earlier) when Arthur, who completed his Ph.D. at The University of Iowa in Clinical Psychology, was invited to join the faculty of the Department of Psychiatry in the College of Medicine.</p>
<p>The couple remembers well when the auditorium first opened its doors in 1972. When they attended the inaugural performance by the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, they knew then that Hancher&#8217;s presence would change this community forever. </p>
<p>Feeling strongly that they wanted to do their part to help Hancher thrive, the Canters made their first gift in 1976; through the years they have increased their giving, and are now proud contributors at the Hancher Inner Circle level.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hancher is a major factor contributing to our quality of life here,&#8221; says Arthur. &#8220;Not every community is fortunate enough to have a resource like this.&#8221; </p>
<p>The couple appreciates the diversity of the Hancher artists. Primarily fans of classical music (Arthur particularly takes pleasure in writing program notes for these concerts), they also love dance, jazz, and theatre&#8212;and enjoy the opportunity to experience artists from around the globe, from Asian dance to African song. &#8220;So many individuals and businesses in the community partner with Hancher to make this amazing range of performances possible,&#8221; says Arthur. </p>
<p>The Canters especially value Hancher&#8217;s commitment to young audiences. Thanks to generous private support, Hancher&#8217;s educational programming reaches out across the state, emphasizing that the children who learn to appreciate the arts today will be tomorrow&#8217;s audiences.</p>
<p>Hancher welcomes all donors&#8212;from those who give annually to provide immediate support for each season, to those who are able to make additional outright or deferred gifts in support of Hancher&#8217;s endowment and the future quality of its offerings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Each year we look forward to a new season of great performances, and each season we renew our commitment to Hancher as a valued part of this community,&#8221; says Miriam. &#8220;We simply could not imagine Iowa without Hancher. And it is up to those of us who love Hancher to ensure that it remains a quality arts presenter. It&#8217;s not the amount of the gift that matters&#8212;it is the consistency and commitment of the giver.&#8221;</p>
<p>She adds, &#8220;When we support an organization, most of us want reassurance that our gifts are making a difference. Each time we attend a Hancher performance, we can see exactly how our gift is benefiting the artists and hundreds of appreciative audience members.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/libraries1.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="libraries1" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Iowa City, Iowa</p>
<p>For Bill and Celia Burger of Iowa City, libraries are an essential part of community life. And as their substantial planned gift in 2002 to UI Libraries shows, the couple believe that supporting libraries is an important expression of social responsibility.</p>
<p>Bill, who graduated from the UI College of Law in 1963, has served as a senior vice president and trust officer with U.S. Bank in Iowa City until his recent appointment as Market President in Iowa City. He has been active in library development for years, beginning with 17 years of service on the Waterloo, Iowa, public library&#8217;s board of directors. After the couple moved to Iowa City in 1990, he became a member&#8212;and for a time, president&#8212;of the Iowa City Public Library Friends Foundation. </p>
<p>Eventually Bill joined the Friends of the University Libraries Board, serving a year as president. He still sits on the board, and he is also a member of the National Steering Committee for the UI&#8217;s comprehensive campaign, called <a href="/campaign/"><em>Good. Better. Best. Iowa: The Campaign to Advance Our Great University.</em></a> Clearly, giving back to the UI is an important part of Bill&#8217;s civic life.</p>
<p>Celia is an educator and literacy expert. Among other positions, she has taught in classrooms, developed district-wide cultural literacy curricula for the Waterloo Community School District, and opened Iowa City&#8217;s Irving B. Weber Elementary as its first principal. Currently, she is the director of curriculum for the Iowa-based company Breakthrough to Literacy, a McGraw-Hill company that grew out of research at the UI College of Education. With her background, it is no surprise that libraries&#8212;including UI Libraries&#8212;are important to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;As an educator, I understand the critical value of access to a well-supported library at all levels of learning,&#8221; Celia says.</p>
<p>The Burgers see their support for UI libraries as an investment in UI students. &#8220;By sharing and encouraging others to do so as well,&#8221; Celia says, &#8220;we help ensure that future generations will have the opportunity to succeed in the new century.&#8221;</p>
<p>With committed individuals like Bill and Celia leading the way, the future of UI Libraries is in good hands.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/student-aid1.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="student-aid1" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Fort Madison, Iowa</p>
<p>During more than 30 years in South Carolina, Gwen (1958 B.A., 1960 M.A.) and Lyle (1959 B.A.) Brown never lost sight of their University of Iowa roots. Sure, it was hard to watch Hawkeye football games, but they always kept tabs on their alma mater and made annual gifts to help ensure that the UI had the resources to excel. </p>
<p>Now that the couple is retired, it&rsquo;s much easier to cheer on the Hawkeyes and stay in touch with the UI in general. Lyle had long told Gwen that if she could find a nice piece of property overlooking the Mississippi River, he&rsquo;d be happy to retire there. Gwen called his bluff, and found them a home in Fort Madison, Iowa, where Gwen grew up downriver from Lyle, a native of Clinton, Iowa.</p>
<p>Because the Browns wanted students from the Fort Madison and Clinton high schools to have the same educational opportunities they had, the couple had included The University of Iowa Foundation in their estate planning with a bequest to establish a scholarship. After moving back to Iowa, one way they took advantage of their newfound proximity to Iowa City was to attend the UI Foundation&rsquo;s annual <strong>Named Scholarship Luncheon</strong>, at which scholarship donors and recipients get together to celebrate their shared love for the University.</p>
<p>At the luncheon in 2002, they realized that as happy as they were to have provided for a scholarship after they were gone, they wanted to be able to help students right away. &ldquo;We decided we had the money, so why not establish the scholarship now when we can see the benefits?&rdquo; says Lyle, who retired from the South Carolina Department of Social Services. </p>
<p><strong>To make their gift,</strong> <strong>they used appreciated stock on which they would have otherwise had to pay capital gains taxes</strong>. &ldquo;It was easy,&rdquo; Lyle says. &ldquo;The UI Foundation gave us instructions on the proper wording, and we called our broker and had the transfer done.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Gwen, who worked as a guidance counselor, notes the satisfaction of seeing their generosity in action. &ldquo;The UI does a great job of selecting who receives our scholarships,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;and then we get to announce the recipients each year at Fort Madison High School, which is a lot of fun.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She and Lyle&#8212;who are members of The Presidents Club, which recognizes the University&rsquo;s most generous benefactors, and life members of the UI Alumni Association&#8212;also enjoy keeping in touch with &ldquo;their&rdquo; students.</p>
<p>No one knows where those students&rsquo; lives will take them&#8212; but the Browns will always have the satisfaction of knowing they helped them get there with the <strong>Lyle and Gwen Brown Scholarships</strong>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/boardman.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="boardman" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Cedar Rapids, Iowa</p>
<p>&quot;For us, giving back wasn’t really a choice we had to make.  It was simply the right thing to do,” says John Boardman.  </p>
<p>John and his wife, Wendy, have established three scholarships at the UI: one in the College of Nursing, one in the College of Public Health, and one in the Roy J. and Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine.</p>
<p>The Boardmans are 1987 UI graduates of the bachelor of science in nursing program; John also received a master’s degree in hospital and health administration from the UI in 1991.  His first job after leaving the UI was working in a hospice program in Miami, Florida—a position that determined his career path.  </p>
<p>The Boardmans returned to Iowa and founded Amenity Hospice Care in Cedar Rapids, a Medicare-certified hospice service that specializes in the care of individuals with dementia, heart disease, and lung disease.  </p>
<p>As a student at the UI, John Boardman was awarded the Ellen Anderson Scholarship in the College of Nursing.  He says, “Receiving a scholarship allowed me to focus on my studies, and I think that made a big difference in my academic success.”  </p>
<p>The Boardmans feel that creating scholarships is the best way to support today’s UI students interested in pursuing careers in geriatrics, hospice work, and/or palliative care or end-of-life care services.  </p>
<p>The John and Wendy Boardman/Amenity Foundation Geriatric Palliative Care Scholarship, established in 2004, is awarded yearly to an undergraduate or graduate nursing student with a minimum 3.0 grade point average.  Three students have already received the award.  </p>
<p>The John and Wendy Boardman/Amenity Foundation E2 (Exceeding Expectations) Scholarship, founded in 2005, is awarded annually to a 2nd- or 3rd-year Master of Health Administration student with an entrepreneurial spirit.  </p>
<p>The Boardmans have also made a gift commitment to create the John and Wendy Boardman/Amenity Foundation Medical Student Scholarship, which will benefit a 3rd- or 4th-year medical student each year.  </p>
<p>“Amenity Hospice and the Amenity Foundation were founded to help meet the growing need for end-of-life care here in eastern Iowa,” says John Boardman.  “We hope these scholarships will prove significant in our continuing mission to proactively address eastern Iowa’s growing geriatric population and corresponding end-of-life care needs.”</p>
<p>Because they live near Iowa City, each year the couple has been able to meet the scholarship recipients and their families.  “We feel very fortunate to be in a position to give back at this time in our lives,” says Wendy Boardman.  “It is such a pleasure to see the results of our giving firsthand—the students have impressed us with their dedication and enthusiasm.”</p>
<p>She adds, “At the Amenity Foundation, we are committed to and we encourage this type of crucial educational support for nurses, administrators, and physicians in eastern Iowa.”</p>
<p>“This scholarship is a wonderful example of how an enlightened health care provider can support the community it serves,” says Rita Frantz, the Kelting Dean and professor of nursing.  “Wendy and John Boardman’s commitment to preparing nurses for this important work is typical of their thoughtful approach to the health and welfare of Iowa citizens.” </p>

		<description><![CDATA[“I immediately considered how I could direct the funding to do the most good.” - Deborah Dawson]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/bernstein.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="bernstein" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Sioux City, Iowa</p>
<p>In 1999, a Santa Monica Mirror columnist made special mention of Morris Bernstein, a 1939 University of Iowa graduate: “Morris Bernstein, my dentist, who recently retired, had a Westside practice for decades. I mention him because a) he was a pillar of the Santa Monica community, b) he had insanely loyal patients, a c) he is a terrific guy.”</p>
<p>Although Bernstein loved serving patients in his adopted home of California, the Sioux City native always considered himself an Iowan first, and he never let go of his Midwestern roots. He visited campus often and maintained close ties with the UI College of Dentistry—and before he died in 2005, he made sure to plant one final seed here: he created the Morris Bernstein Professorship in Dentistry by establishing an endowed fund through the UI Foundation.</p>
<p>Seventy years since Bernstein’s graduation, that seed is taking root. This year, Deborah Dawson, professor and director of biostatistics in the college, became the first recipient of the Bernstein Professorship.</p>
<p>“This is just an incredible honor,” Dawson says. “I immediately considered how I could direct the funding to do the most good. I knew I wanted to support my colleagues’ work as well as my own, and advance important initiatives that will have a positive impact in the community.”</p>
<p>Dawson is using the funds to enhance several of the studies in which she is involved. One project that is being carried out in locations around Iowa focuses on the impact of teaching mothers good oral health practices for their children. Another study in Muscatine is looking at the genetic causes of childhood cavities, and a third is directed toward preventing cavities in Native American children, and exploring community interventions that can reduce disparities in health care for disadvantaged communities.</p>
<p>“These are all public health issues that affect children and families everywhere,” says Dawson. “The outcomes could have a huge impact not only here in Iowa, but around the country and the world.”</p>
<p>David Johnsen, D. D. S., dean of the UI College of Dentistry, says, “Deborah was an easy choice for this honor—she is an outstanding researcher, teacher, and collaborator. If you wanted to exemplify how a professorship should be used, this is the model.”</p>
<p>Endowed faculty support is valuable because it helps the University attract and retain top teachers and researchers and enables them to do their best work. Most important, it ensures that UI students receive the best possible education.</p>
<p>Johnsen notes, “Morris always said he wanted to give back to the college because he felt that he learned more than just professional skills here—he acquired the personal values that guided his life. He wanted to ensure that this well-rounded, quality education continues here for others.”</p>
<p>Says Dawson, “People who make a contribution like this are creating the opportunity to get an idea off the ground, or to accelerate an existing project and attract even more funding. It buys us time to focus on work that can have a significant impact in improving people’s lives.”</p>
<p>Morris Bernstein: a pillar of the UI Dentistry community, intensely loyal to Iowa and the University, and yes, a terrific guy.</p>

		<description><![CDATA["It's only fitting we give back to the university for making our success possible."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/bennet.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="bennet" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Mahtomedi, Minnesota </p>
<p>With decades of experience in education between them, David (1967 B.A., 1968 M.A., 1971 Ph.D.) and Sheila (1967 B.A., 1969 M.A.) Bennett understand the importance of helping the teachers of tomorrow in whatever way they can.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dave and I share a lifelong commitment to enhancing the quality of public education,&#8221; says Sheila Bennett. &#8220;We believe the foundation for that is the quality of education programs at the university level.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Bennetts credit the teachers they encountered while students at the University of Iowa for starting them on their paths to success in education. David and Sheila each received a bachelor&#8217;s degree in English and a certification in secondary education from the UI, and both went on to teach at the high school level while pursuing graduate studies. David Bennett eventually earned a doctoral degree in educational administration, while Sheila earned her master&#8217;s degree in English education.</p>
<p>After years of work in teaching and administrative roles, the Bennetts look back fondly at the training they received in the University of Iowa College of Education. &#8220;In my career as an English teacher and a literacy specialist, I benefited greatly from the excellent preparation I received at Iowa,&#8221; says Sheila Bennett. &#8220;My gratitude for that runs deep.&#8221; Giving back to the UI gives them an opportunity to express that gratitude and lead by example in supporting their alma mater. &#8220;Philanthropy is one of the ways we can convey our values,&#8221; says David Bennett.</p>
<p>Those values have been clearly expressed through the couple&#8217;s bequest to establish the <strong>David and Sheila Bennett Fund for Educational Administration</strong>, and the <strong>David and Sheila Bennett Fund for English Education</strong>. The endowed funds will pave the way for promising young educators.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only fitting we give back to the university for making our success possible,&#8221; says David Bennett. &#8220;Being able to do so at this stage of our lives is very satisfying, and we believe the UI College of Education is a worthy recipient of our gift.&#8221;</p>
<p>The UI College of Education is thankful for generous alumni like the Bennetts, whose contributions help students start, and continue, along their paths to success in education.</p>

		<description><![CDATA["We challenge today's students, when they're able, to in turn help future students receive an education."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/beisner.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="beisner" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Springfield, Missouri</p>
<p>&quot;Our nation&#8217;s most important infrastructure isn&#8217;t made up of roads and sewers and bridges,&quot; said Donald Beisner (1964 M.D., 1970 R.). &quot;It&#8217;s our educational system, from our elementary schools through our universities.&quot;</p>
<p>Beisner, an ophthalmologist who died in 2010, and his wife, Judith (1961 B.A.), have helped bolster that educational infrastructure by giving to the University of Iowa Roy J. and Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine (CCOM).</p>
<p>The Beisners, of Springfield, Missouri, worked with the UI Foundation to establish the <strong>Judith (Gardner) and Donald H. Beisner, M.D. Professorship for Vitreoretinal Diseases and Surgery</strong>.</p>
<p>The Beisners funded their professorship through both outright gifts while Don was living and a <a href="http://www.gftpln.org/stelterweb/CategoryDetailList.do?orgId=158&amp;categoryId=222">bequest</a>. The outright gifts allowed the college to immediately put the professorship into effect, with the bequest&#8212;which came to the UI Foundation after Don&#8217;s death&#8212;completing the endowment of the position.</p>
<p>The bequest, made with a portion of the Beisners&#8217; retirement assets, was part of the couple&#8217;s overall estate planning. The deferred commitment enabled the Beisners to have a major impact on the UI Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences&#8212;which Don credited with giving him the education he needed to launch his successful career&#8212;while helping the UI reach its $1 billion goal in the <a href="http://www.uifoundation.org/campaign/"><em>Good. Better. Best. Iowa</em> comprehensive campaign</a>, which ended in 2005. </p>
<p>&quot;I got a terrific education at a great price,&quot; said Don, a native of Cedar Falls, Iowa. &quot;<a href="http://www.givetoiowa.org/eye">Ophthalmology</a> at Iowa has always been strong and the retina service, led by Dr. Robert Watzke when I was a resident, was especially strong. It&#8217;s time to give back.&quot;</p>
<p>The Beisners&#8217; support for the UI Carver College of Medicine extends beyond their professorship. Since 1999, the <strong>Beisner Scholar Awards</strong> have been helping CCOM students with the ever-increasing financial burdens of medical school. </p>
<p>&quot;Excellence breeds excellence, and mediocrity breeds mediocrity,&quot; Don pointed out. &quot;Judy and I hope our scholarships can attract very well-qualified students to Iowa. And we challenge today&#8217;s students, when they&#8217;re able, to in turn help future students receive an education.&quot; </p>
<p>In addition, the <strong>Beisner Lecture Halls</strong> in the Bowen Science Building offer students and faculty an exceptional educational environment. There are three Beisner halls, one named in memory of the Beisners&#8217; daughter, Sarah, who died in 1989; another in honor of Dr. Watzke; and a third in honor of Bruce Spivey (1959 M.D., 1964 M.S.), another former UI teacher and mentor for Dr. Beisner.</p>
<p>&quot;The lecture halls when I was a student were a shame, like giant pits,&quot; Don remembered, explaining his motivation for funding the Beisner Lecture Halls. &quot;These new spaces have Internet access and more. What great places in which to teach and learn.&quot;</p>
<p>The Beisners have witnessed the effects that a stellar education can have on individuals and on their ability to be of service to their professions and communities.</p>
<p>By giving to the UI and CCOM&#8212;in addition to gifts to Iowa State University, the public schools in Cedar Falls, and other educational initiatives at all levels&#8212;they&#8217;ve done what they can to keep that educational foundation secure and strong. </p>
<p>As Donald Beisner pointed out, that&#8217;s the kind of bridge&#8212;leading to the betterment of future generations&#8212;that is the true backbone of society.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/beckwith.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="beckwith" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Des Moines, Iowa</p>
<p>As a former University of Iowa Hawkeye women&#8217;s basketball letterwinner, <strong>Sue Beckwith</strong> knows something about being part of a disciplined squad focused on a common goal. But when she started rowing recreationally years later, she really came to understand teamwork.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rowing is a wonderful, difficult sport, the ultimate team sport,&#8221; Beckwith, a Des Moines surgeon, says. &#8220;In basketball, you can take over and take the ball and do something. With rowing, you have to mirror everybody else and do the exact same thing that everybody else does. <strong>It&#8217;s just a tremendous sport</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p>That appreciation for rowing led her to a Hawkeye rowing practice early one morning. The strength and determination of the student-athletes she saw that day&#8212;and the conditions in which they worked so hard to represent their University&#8212;left a powerful impression on her. </p>
<p>Now, Beckwith has forever altered the future of UI athletics and generations of student-athletes. With the help of her extremely generous leadership gift to The University of Iowa Foundation, the UI has begun work on the <strong>P. Sue Beckwith, M.D., Boathouse. </strong></p>
<p>Beckwith, who earned two degrees from the UI (1980 B.A., 1984 M.D.), was motivated to make her gift by her loyalty for her alma mater, her respect for the rowers and their coaches, and&#8212;most of all&#8212;by <strong>the dire need for the rowing team to have a permanent home</strong>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The team has been housed in the Iowa Advanced Technology Laboratories. When I visited their practice, the rowers had thrown tarps and pads on the floor in between the boats to do their warm-ups,&#8221; Beckwith recalls. &#8220;There were no restroom facilities, no locker room facilities. We&#8217;re not talking about the kids not having some oak-paneled lounge with big-screen TV&#8217;s. They have nothing.&#8221;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Thanks to leadership from Beckwith&#8212;who has also endowed athletic scholarships for Hawkeye rowers and women&#8217;s basketball players&#8212;that&#8217;s going to change with the construction of the P. Sue Beckwith, M.D. Boathouse. </p>
<p>Fundraising on the project is ongoing. As with the sport Beckwith has come to love, <strong>everyone will have to pull together to meet the goals necessary to build a facility</strong> which will advance the UI rowing team&#8217;s competitiveness in the Big Ten and nationally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&#8221;It&#8217;s a big project,&#8221; Beckwith says. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to need a lot of help and a lot people on board contributing their efforts.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/student-aid4.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="student-aid4" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Vinton, Iowa</p>
<p>Ida Cordelia Beam never attended The University of Iowa. She never taught or worked at the UI. And she passed away in 1976. Yet year in and year out, she plays a key role in stimulating the intellectual vitality and vigor of our University.</p>
<p> You might recognize Ida Beam’s name from an ongoing series of campus readings, lectures, and discussions offered by the UI each year. These Ida Beam presentations are given by participants in the <strong><a href="http://provost.uiowa.edu/faculty/idabeam/" target="_blank">Ida Cordelia Beam Distinguished Visiting Professorships Program</a></strong>—some of the best minds in their respective disciplines who come from other world-class institutions to share, and add to, their expertise and insights. </p>
<p> The program has existed since 1978, and the 2010-2011 slate of Ida Beam visiting professors gives a sense of the breadth of its offerings: 11 visiting professors, sponsored by more than 30 UI programs and departments ranging from the Iowa Writers’ Workshop to the College of Law to the Museum of Art to&nbsp; the Communication Studies Department in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p> Who was Ida Cordelia Beam and how did she come to have such a profound impact on the UI? She was a school teacher who grew up in and around Vinton, Iowa, before living most of her adult life in Oregon until her death at age 96. Because of her keen appreciation for education, she had the foresight to include a charitable bequest in her will, leaving her family’s farm in Benton County, Iowa, to The University of Iowa Foundation. The farm was sold, according to her wishes, and the proceeds were used to establish the program in her name.</p>
<p><strong>You, too, can have a lasting influence on the life of the UI.</strong> If you include a charitable bequest—of real estate, cash, life insurance benefits, or other assets—in your estate plans to support any area of the University, you can be assured of leaving an Iowa legacy while retaining the right to modify the bequest as your and your family’s needs evolve. Be sure to tell us about your bequest—confidentially and at no obligation to you—so we can ensure that it’s used to carry out your philanthropic goals.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/baumback.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="baumback" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Iowa City, Iowa</p>
<p>Janice Baumback (1971 M.S.W.) is a woman who makes choices with care.</p>
<p>&#8220;My family owes the UI a whole lot. More than we can ever pay back,&#8221; said Baumback, who was married for nearly 50 years to the late Clifford Baumback (1953 Ph.D.), a professor in what is now the UI Henry B. Tippie College of Business.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why she chose to create the Clifford M. Baumback Entrepreneurial Studies Award in the <a href="http://www5.uifoundation.org/business/">Tippie College of Business</a>, and the Janice S. Baumback Graduate Student Award in the School of Social Work, which is part of the <a href="http://www5.uifoundation.org/liberal-arts/">College of Liberal Arts and Sciences</a>.</p>
<p>Born in Shanghai, China, Janice Baumback came a long way to become so committed an Iowa fan. Her father was a professor at Jiao Tong University until she was five, when the family relocated to Seattle during China&#8217;s bloody civil war.</p>
<p>She received a B.A. degree in sociology from the University of Washington in 1944 and had nearly completed work on an M.B.A. degree at Northwestern University when she met and married Clifford. The two moved to Oklahoma when he was offered an academic position, then to Iowa City, where he completed a Ph.D. degree in industrial management.</p>
<p>Clifford overcame a decade of serious health problems and began teaching in the UI business school in 1962. When he retired in 1980, he was a nationally renowned expert in the field of small business. He died in 1995.</p>
<p>In 1968, Janice made a key decision in her life, returning to school for an M.S.W. degree&#8212;attending the UI along with two of her three grown children. She enjoyed a 14-year career as a social worker in the UI Department of Child Psychiatry&#8212;and stays in touch with some of the families she served.</p>
<p>Service remains central to Baumback&#8217;s life&#8212;her commitments reveal thoughtful choices about giving back to the community. The scholarships she created will benefit many generations of UI students, and she volunteers many hours to help local human services organizations.</p>
<p>She also made gifts in the form of a <a href="http://www.gftpln.org/stelterweb/CategoryDetailList.do?orgId=158&#038;categoryId=228">charitable gift annuity (CGA)</a> to the <a href="http://www5.uifoundation.org/museums/">UI Museum of Natural History</a> and <a href="http://www5.uifoundation.org/hancher/">Hancher Auditorium</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m altruistic, but I&#8217;m also a pragmatist,&#8221; she said. &#8220;With a CGA, one can invest in programs that one believes in&#8212;especially programs like these that so enrich our lives&#8212;and also receive a guaranteed income at an attractive rate of return.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all given three things in different proportions: time, talent, and treasures, and we must choose what to do with them,&#8221; said Baumback. &#8220;I believe it&#8217;s our responsibility to use these gifts to help the community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some decisions come easy&#8212;and The University of Iowa is grateful for the choices Baumback has made.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/student-aid3.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="student-aid3" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Iowa City, Iowa</p>
<p>For Dale and Linda Baker, the seeds of philanthropy were sown long ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dad always said he never wanted to be the richest guy in the cemetery,&#8221; says Linda Baker. &#8220;I guess that has always stuck with me.&#8221; </p>
<p>Linda Baker&#8217;s father was a successful certified public accountant in Evanston, Illinois. He took classes over the years at Northwestern University, though rules requiring on-campus residency at the time prevented him from receiving a degree. He still believed strongly in the value of higher education, and even helped fund the college education of one of Linda&#8217;s friends in need.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re able, help out other students,&#8221; Linda Baker recalls her father saying. And the Bakers did just that, helping a friend of their son&#8217;s with college costs years later.</p>
<p>Dale and Linda Baker met as freshmen on the UI campus, sharing their first date at a Hawkeye men&#8217;s basketball game at the old Field House on a blustery winter night. They both graduated from the UI in 1968—Dale with a B.B.A. degree in business administration and accounting, and Linda with a B.A. degree in English and a secondary education certification—and were married in July of that year.</p>
<p>The Bakers&#8217; belief in giving back has touched countless students and faculty at their alma mater over the years. They have long been generous supporters of various UI programs and initiatives, and are platinum members of the University of Iowa Presidents Club. Most recently, they made a gift of more than $1 million to the UI through the University of Iowa Foundation—support that will benefit people throughout campus and well beyond.</p>
<p>A $250,000 portion of the gift was made to endow the Dr. Ken Magid Child Advocacy Service Scholarship fund. The scholarship, administered by the University of Iowa Alumni Association, was established in 2005 by Linda Baker to honor her mentor, Dr. Kenneth Magid, whose wide-ranging career had a tremendous influence on her own career and service efforts. The fund helps UI students cover expenses related to volunteer service-learning opportunities in orphanages in Romania. Linda Baker traveled to Romania with the UI Alumni Association&#8217;s Iowa Voyagers program in the spring of 2005 to work for three weeks in an orphanage and was so moved by the experience that she established the scholarship.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I returned from my own experience, I thought it would be great to be able to send students on the trip as well,&#8221; says Linda Baker. When she shared that thought with Diane Baker, who is not related to Dale and Linda Baker, in the UI Alumni Association, the idea to fund the scholarship was born. &#8220;It was a true case of two heads being better than one,&#8221; says Linda Baker.</p>
<p>In addition to the scholarship gift, the Bakers made a gift of $1 million to the UI Alumni Association Vision Endowment Fund. The Vision Endowment Fund helps provide stable, long-term financial support to enhance connections between Iowa alumni, friends, and the UI.</p>
<p> &#8220;Creating secure sources of funding is important as it helps satisfy the ongoing need to reach out to different age groups, and the need to experiment with ways to keep different people connected to the UI,&#8221; says Dale Baker.</p>
<p>Despite the decades that have passed since graduation, the Bakers maintain their connection to the UI campus through their philanthropy. They also remain connected to the many friends they met during their time as students, as well as new UI friends they&#8217;ve made since—thanks in part to events facilitated by the UI Alumni Association.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the many things the UI Alumni Association has to offer is also a lot of fun,&#8221; says Dale Baker. &#8220;We&#8217;ve met some fantastic people over the years through events they&#8217;ve coordinated.&#8221;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[“I just really needed to support this. It is critical to support researchers with good ideas who need funding to develop their work.”]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/assink.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="Assink" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Cedar Rapids, Iowa</p>
<p>When faced with the prospect of losing his vision and the ability to enjoy the theatre, Robert J. “Bob” Assink took action. It was a sobering and frightening possibility for someone with a longtime appreciation for the theatre arts—a very visual experience—in both his professional and personal life.</p>
<p>Bob, who lives in Cedar Rapids, made a sizable bequest to The University of Iowa Foundation to create the Robert J. Assink Glaucoma Fund, which will support research for prevention and treatment of the disease within the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences in the UI academic medical center. He established the fund to assist Young Kwon, M.D., Ph.D., with his clinical care, teaching, and research—and more broadly, to support the department’s mission of excellence. </p>
<p>When Bob, who received a B.A. degree in speech and theatre from the University of Northern Iowa in 1962, visited his local ophthalmologist, David Puk, for a routine eye exam, Puk saw a problem in his patient’s eyes that needed to be dealt with. As a UI alumnus, Puk immediately referred Bob to Kwon, one of Puk’s former teachers, at UI Hospitals and Clinics. Bob was impressed with the connection that remains between Puk and Kwon, as well as the level of service and expertise he received at the UI. Because of Kwon’s professional, patient, and personal manner, Bob knew he was in good hands at the UI.</p>
<p>To help maintain the quality of care in the department of ophthalmology, as well as increase and improve the treatments for glaucoma, he has participated in several research studies. Now, through the fund he has established, Bob will be able to help even more with the fight against glaucoma.</p>
<p>Bob, who retired in 2002, spent his life teaching high school speech, theatre, and other language arts, and he is highly committed to supporting education at all levels. Through the treatment he has received as a glaucoma patient at the UI, he has seen how research and education go hand in hand in an academic medical center like Iowa’s. </p>
<p>“Without the work of the department and my highly skilled doctors, I might be blind right now,” said the Cedar Falls, Iowa, native. “I just really needed to support this. It is critical to support researchers with good ideas who need funding to develop their work.”</p>
<p>Bob is grateful that the several surgeries he has had have prevented him from experiencing vision loss. And he is proud that, through making decisions now about how he’d like his estate assets used later, he can play a role in sustaining the unification of education, research, and clinical care in the work of doctors like Kwon at The University of Iowa. </p>

		<description><![CDATA["The cancer center was a protective, caring environment. I felt comfortable and safe there."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/rose-garfinkle.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="rose-garfinkle" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Birthdays mean a lot more to Rose Garfinkle these days. <strong>&#8220;Every year, I&#8217;m just thankful to be alive,&#8221;</strong> she says. &#8220;It&#8217;s like icing on the cake.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 1994, when Rose was 38, a physician at the <a href="http://www.uihealthcare.com/depts/cancercenter/">UI&#8217;s Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> (HCCC) confirmed her worst fears: The breast cancer she thought she&#8217;d beaten&#8212;with a mastectomy two years earlier at HCCC&#8212;had returned.</p>
<p>With a three-year-old daughter and a husband at home, and a demanding career as a graphic designer and manager, Rose was catapulted into a world of uncertainty and turmoil. Fortunately, though, she was under the care of the expert staff at HCCC, one of America&#8217;s premier cancer centers. And from the oncologists to the receptionists, <strong>they set to work caring for Rose</strong>&#8212;not just physically, but emotionally as well.</p>
<p>Supported by generous contributions large and small, the center is truly a comprehensive one, providing <strong>compassionate care</strong> for patients like Rose and advanced research so fewer cancer patients will need that care in the future.</p>
<p>HCCC arrranged for Rose to speak with other women who&#8217;d been through the same ordeal, women who became Rose&#8217;s good friends. The center was responsive to her questions and needs. Her husband, Barry Markovsky, was welcomed into the process; when Rose stayed in the hospital for a month following an autologous bone-marrow transplant, Barry spent much of that time by her side writing the <em>Rose Report,</em> a newsletter about her progress that he sent to friends and family. One nurse was assigned to Rose throughout her time at the center, assuring continuity and familiarity. Rose had ready access to the hospital&#8217;s library.</p>
<p>Rose sums up the experience this way: &#8220;The cancer center was a <strong>protective, caring environment</strong>. I felt comfortable and safe there.&#8221;</p>
<p>All the while, Rose was undergoing advanced, aggressive treatment featuring bone-marrow transplant techniques that had been developed partly by UI researchers. That extensive treatment saved her life. No longer a cancer patient, Rose has become a <strong>cancer survivor</strong>, thanks to HCCC. </p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m incredibly proud to be part of the survivor community,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Now Rose, who has since moved from Iowa City to Columbia, South Carolina, gives back to HCCC and fellow survivors. She serves on the center&#8217;s Advocacy Board. She offers support to other women, just as patients before her did for her. And most of all, she&#8217;s a believer in the power of advanced medicine joined with compassionate, patient-centered care&#8212;the specialty of the Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center.</p>

Wilkinson, the director of the Low Vision Rehabilitation Service, a program of the <a href="http://www.givetoiowa.org/cmd/">Center for Macular Degeneration</a> in UI Hospitals and Clinics, sees the impact of private support daily. And because of that support, the individuals who benefit from the program&#8217;s services <strong>can see everything more clearly</strong>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our program provides a full continuum of services&#8212;medical, physical, psychological, and social&#8212;to help individuals with impaired visual functioning lead more productive, satisfying lives,&#8221; Dr. Wilkinson says.</p>
<p>&#8220;The range of devices we offer runs the gamut, too,&#8221; he says, &#8220;from special reading glasses to magnifiers and telescopes to video magnification devices.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, such devices can be expensive to acquire, and health insurance generally does not provide coverage for them. Fortunately, <strong><br />
private gifts help bridge the gap</strong>, allowing this innovative program of UI Hospitals and Clinics to better serve the residents of Iowa and the region.</p>
<p>&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t be more grateful for the generosity of those who help us in our mission,&#8221; Dr. Wilkinson says. &#8220;<strong><br />
Because of them, we are able to empower people to live life to the fullest.</strong>&#8220;</p>

		<description><![CDATA["When an opportunity came, I wasn't denied the chance to seize upon it just because I didn't have the financial ability to go."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/jack-lynch.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="jack-lynch" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>As a 34-year-old single parent, Jack Lynch decided to give his dreams a shot. The Iowa City native had been working at UI Hospitals and Clinics, but his true love was the theatre. So he went back to school to nurture his talent. </p>
<p>After doing some undergraduate work at the UI, Jack received his degree at another university. But when it came time for graduate school, the UI offered him an opportunity to create a self-styled M.F.A. program in theatre, which included dance. He thrived&#8212;and with a <strong>special boost given to him by contributors to the Iowa Impact Fund</strong>, he has gone on to establish a successful and fulfilling career in theatre.</p>
<p>While in the graduate program, Jack received an opportunity to travel to New York City to perform an original piece at the prestigious and influential La Mama Experimental Theatre. It was an opportunity he couldn&#8217;t pass up, but he couldn&#8217;t afford the trip. He tried to get help from various University sources&#8212;but the <strong>specific designations for those funds didn&#8217;t match his need</strong>.</p>
<p>Performing in New York, however, would clearly be an important step for this talented artist&#8217;s career, so the director of his M.F.A. program requested funding from the <strong>unrestricted Iowa Impact Fund</strong> (which was then known as the Iowa Opportunity Fund). </p>
<p>With these unrestricted resources, the UI was able to step in quickly and help cover costs for the trip&#8212;and because of thoughtful contributors, <strong>Jack&#8217;s life was forever changed for the better</strong>.</p>
<p>Jack says, &#8220;Because of the Iowa Impact Fund, when an opportunity came, I wasn&#8217;t denied the chance to seize upon it just because I didn&#8217;t have the financial ability to go. <strong>I will always be grateful for that.</strong>&#8220;</p>
<p>Now Jack, who received his M.F.A. in theatre arts in 1996, lives in London, directing and nurturing his passion for teaching at the esteemed Guildford School of Acting. In 1999 he and his wife, actor and UI graduate Edie Campbell (she earned her M.A. degree in English in 1993) formed their own theatre company, LynchPin Productions. </p>
<p>Recently Jack returned home in an exciting fashion&#8212;in March 2002, he and Edie came to Iowa City to produce their one-woman play, <em>Emily Dickinson and I,</em> which has received critical acclaim in London and at the Edinburgh Festival, at Iowa City&#8217;s Riverside Theatre.</p>
<p><strong>All Jack needed was a chance.</strong> Thanks to the Iowa Impact Fund, he got that chance and is still making the most of it.</p>

		<description><![CDATA["The physicians and staff got to know my mother so well; they really care personally about every patient."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/heidi-wagler.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="heidi-wagler" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>An important part of Kay Bernau&#8217;s legacy is easing the suffering of other women as they fight breast cancer.</p>
<p>Kay felt so strongly about the positive treatment she received at the <a href="http://www.uihealthcare.com/depts/cancercenter/">Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> (HCCC) that after she died of the disease in 2003, her family decided to use the memorial gifts to establish a special patient-care fund.</p>
<p>Today, the <strong>Kay Bernau Fund for Breast Cancer Compassionate Patient Care</strong> is helping patients get through treatment that can be both physically and emotionally challenging.</p>
<p>Kay&#8217;s daughter, Heidi Bernau Wagler, joined the HCCC&#8217;s advocacy board after her mother&#8217;s death, assisting the volunteer group in focusing on advocacy, fund raising, and public relations for the center.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Holden Center really goes above and beyond in the way they treat people,&#8221; says Heidi. &#8220;The physicians and staff got to know my mother so well&#8212;<strong>they really care personally about every patient</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The center&#8217;s extraordinary treatment came even closer to home for Heidi when she herself developed breast cancer in 2005 and was successfully treated at the Holden Center. &#8220;When I found the lump, I went straight to my mother&#8217;s doctor. He took so much time with me, I felt as though he would have been willing to answer my questions all afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Within a week, Heidi had a diagnosis and started treatment. Thankfully, the disease was discovered early, and her prognosis is excellent&#8212;good news for her husband and three children.</p>
<p>The experience made the Bernau family feel even more strongly that creating a fund at the center&#8212;giving back in gratitude for their exceptional experience at the HCCC&#8212;was the right thing to do.</p>
<p>&#8220;The staff members were so sensitive to my mother&#8217;s and my needs. They&#8217;d often give us little gifts or show personal gestures of kindness,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fund we created provides special care for women who might not be able to afford &#8216;extras&#8217;&#8212;for example, women in chemotherapy often find that their fingers get numb. The fund might pay for a manicure or pedicure&#8212;or in some way provide assistance and comfort.&#8221; </p>
<p>Supported by generous contributions large and small, the Holden Center is one of only 39 &#8220;<a href="http://www3.cancer.gov/cancercenters/centerslist.html">National Cancer Institute Comprehensive Cancer Centers</a>&#8221; nationwide, a title that recognizes a comprehensive approach encompassing the areas of cancer care, research, and education. </p>
<p>&#8220;Because I serve on the HCCC advocacy board, I know how crucial private support is to the center,&#8221; says Heidi. &#8220;Whether a gift is supporting the little things that help a patient feel better, or research that may one day lead to a cure for breast cancer, <strong>every gift makes an important difference</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p>She adds, &#8220;It means a lot that we could honor my mother&#8217;s memory&#8212;and her caring nature&#8212;in this way.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/david-gompper.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="david-gompper" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Last May, when University of Iowa faculty member David Gompper accepted a prestigious Academy Award in Music from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in New York City, the honor was a milestone in Gompper’s ongoing career as a composer, performer, conductor, and teacher—and a testament to the UI’s longstanding reputation as a pioneer in the arts.</p>
<p> The occasion was also a demonstration of the enduring power of philanthropy in advancing the arts and an institution like the UI. Gompper is the director of the Center for New Music (CNM)—a performance organization devoted to the late 20th- and early 21st-century repertoire—in the School of Music, which is part of the UI College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. The CNM was initially established by a pair of matching grants from The Rockefeller Foundation in the 1960s, and has been Gompper’s creative home since 1991. As the trailblazing accomplishments of Gompper and the CNM continually prove, those far-sighted gifts have been paying dividends to the University, and to music, for more than four decades.</p>
<p>Here’s how The Rockefeller Foundation explained its motivation for supporting music at the UI in its 1965 annual report: “Of special interest to The Rockefeller Foundation are the possibilities inherent in working with colleges and universities which are genuinely hospitable to the arts of the present, especially those institutions which are willing to innovate on their own campuses . . . There is today a growing sense of awareness in many of our universities that the creative arts should be included in the regular academic curriculum on the same footing as the recognized disciplines of knowledge.” Because the UI was the world&#8217;s first university to accept creative work in music, theatre, writing, and art on an equal basis with academic research—as far back as the 1920s—Iowa was a natural fit for The Rockefeller Foundation’s support. The report continued, “Several universities—notably Buffalo, Chicago, Rutgers, and Iowa—have, with the help of The Rockefeller Foundation, established creative centers in music, bringing together composers and performers to vitalize the musical life of the university campus, but even more to stimulate the musical thinking of the entire region.”</p>
<p>The CNM has lived up to the potential that the foundation saw for musical stimulation, thanks in large part to Gompper’s impassioned dedication to the CNM’s mission. </p>
<p>As UI President Sally Mason says, “The School of Music has a legacy of innovation, and the Center for New Music has played a critical role in that tradition for over 40 years.” College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Dean Linda Maxson agrees, saying, “The Center for New Music plays a vital role in our college’s longstanding commitment to fostering creative work, and David—both as a composer and a colleague—exemplifies the best of the best in our School of Music.”</p>
<p>Gompper, building upon the work of the CNM’s founders, Richard Hervig and William Hibbard, and the subsequent leadership of D. Martin Jenni, sustains a fertile creative environment at the CNM. Through the center, graduate composition students, working with musicians from throughout the School of Music, develop their talent and present their work locally, nationally, and internationally. Students have accompanied Gompper—who taught at the Moscow Conservatory as a Fulbright Scholar in 2002 and 2003—on performance tours around the U.S. and in Europe.</p>
<p>The CNM also provides a venue for music students to gain firsthand exposure to contemporary music, an element often lacking in the training of classical musicians. “Our students are really great musicians,” Gompper says, “but outside of the center, there are few opportunities for them to play recent and challenging contemporary music. So the center is a magnet for these students who need to have these kinds of experiences and show aptitude for this kind of work.”</p>
<p>Composers from around the world have brought their work to the CNM to have it performed as well. A short list of visiting composers of note—some of whom have premiered works at the UI—includes George Crumb, Charles Wuorinen, Morton Feldman, Gunther Schuller, Lukas Foss, and Libby Larson.</p>
<p>The CNM under Gompper’s direction has organized important festivals and programs that have captured the music world’s attention, such as the Russian Contemporary Music Festival in 2000 that was reviewed on the front arts page of <em>The New York Times</em>. </p>
<p>And on top of all those CNM activities, Gompper is an extraordinary performing pianist, regularly playing around the world, from communities in Iowa and the Midwest to Vienna, Moscow, Prague, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It all adds up to a recognition throughout the contemporary music world that the UI is among the leaders of 21st-century innovation in new-music education and creation. Essentially, The Rockefeller Foundation’s gifts long ago created the conditions where a renowned artist such as Gompper—and the students he teaches—can find a creative home and advance Iowa’s reputation in valuable ways, and Gompper is thankful for the opportunity that the CNM has given him. “I’m so blessed to be at Iowa. I’m a very fortunate person,” says Gompper, whom the UI recently awarded a major Arts and Humanities Initiative grant, which he will use to have four of his works recorded by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in London.</p>
<p>Now, as the UI works to overcome the effects of the 2008 flood that destroyed much of the arts campus—including the Voxman Music Building, which housed the School of Music—more such visionary philanthropic support will be crucial to ensure that the UI’s flagship arts programs can continue to excel. “As we rebuild our arts campus for the 21st century, we are dedicated to infusing our plans with the spirit of originality and vision that has long characterized the Center for New Music, the School of Music, and all of our fine-arts programs,” says President Mason.</p>
<p>It will be up to all of us to pull together for the future of the arts at Iowa, through support for new facilities and the faculty and students who will work there. And—as with the gift that created the UI’s Center for New Music—today’s investments will resonate in future decades throughout the University and the global arts community.</p>
<p><em>The Center for New Music and its director, David Gompper, have released a steady stream of recordings and regularly perform concerts at the UI, across the U.S., and around the world.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/brandon-cochran.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="Brandon Cochran" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Brandon Cochran knows much more about ground sloths and Iowa&#8217;s first legislators than the average person. That&#8217;s because the University of Iowa graduate gained an in-depth understanding of both these topics while majoring in anthropology and working as a student intern&#8212;and then an employee&#8212;at the UI Museum of Natural History and Old Capitol Museum.</p>
<p>After graduating from Iowa in 2006 with a bachelor&#8217;s degree and a certificate in museum studies, Brandon accepted a position in museum operations at the Johnson County Historical Society Museum. </p>
<p>He is passionate about the role of museums in both campus and community life. &#8220;<strong>The Pentacrest Museums are just incredible cultural, ecological, and historical resources.</strong> They&#8217;re such a valuable part of our Iowa identity, and they&#8217;re here for everyone&#8212;from students and schoolchildren to teachers and parents,&#8221; says the St. Marys, Iowa, native.</p>
<p>&#8220;These Museums offer a catch-all for people; they can come to one destination&#8212;the UI campus&#8212;and experience the best of Iowa history and culture. When people give to the Museums, they help keep that experience alive and growing.&#8221;</p>
<p>During his work with the Pentacrest Museums, Brandon helped the Museum of Natural History name its new Biosphere Discovery Hub and assisted in preparing Old Capitol Museum for its grand reopening in May 2006, after a November 2001 fire and subsequent renovation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did everything from writing text labels for exhibits and surveying museum users to serving as a docent and adjusting Old Capitol&#8217;s historic bell,&#8221; Brandon says. &#8220;I never would have had these incredible opportunities without contributors&#8217; generous investments in the Pentacrest Museums.&#8221;</p>
<p>Such generosity is what made it possible for Brandon to gain the skills he needed to find work in his field after graduation. And though he&#8217;s no longer working for the Pentacrest Museums, he continues to bring Iowa history and culture to life every day.</p>

This program helped me to both mature as a student and to determine that environmental engineering was my path.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several excellent graduate engineering programs recruited Sharon, and some offered financial packages beyond what the UI had been able to offer. Then the UI Graduate College stepped in, offering Sharon a <b>prestigious Graduate Merit Fellowship</b>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot say enough about how much the Graduate College has offered me as a student and person,&#8221; says Sharon. &#8220;I hope one day to become a college professor and to use my Iowa graduate degree to help developing countries maintain a clean water supply.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sharon&#8217;s story is more than one of individual triumph: She began working toward her Ph.D. degree with two young sons&#8212;Jaylen, 5, and Marquis, 6&#8212;in tow. The Graduate College offered her additional funding to help her move from Louisiana and resettle her family in Iowa City.</p>
<p>&#8220;To be successful you have to be happy,&#8221; Sharon points out. &#8220;The Graduate College&#8217;s <b>financial support</b> and the <b>warm, friendly environment the Graduate College promotes</b> have been key to my success as an engineering student. I wish I could personally thank all supporters of the Graduate College&#8217;s fellowship programs.&#8221; </p>

		<description><![CDATA["Gifts show commitment to excellence in education, and they give people an opportunity to pursue that excellence."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/Sukriti-Nayar1.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="Sukriti-Nayar" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Sukriti Nayar was looking for &#8220;a reputable experience in a reputable institution&#8221; when she began considering colleges. That&#8217;s why she chose the University of Iowa.</p>
<p>The double major in accounting and finance has seen enough of the world to know a good experience in a good place when she finds one. She was born in India and then lived for a time in South Africa before moving to Iowa to become a student in the Henry B. Tippie College of Business.</p>
<p>This global background helped prepare Sukriti for the world of opportunities that she and her classmates have found at Iowa. Unsure of what she wanted to pursue after high school, she counts the breadth and depth of choices at the UI among the reasons she chose to attend. &#8220;Iowa had such a large variety of paths for me,&#8221; Sukriti says. &#8220;I&#8217;m absolutely happy with my choice.&#8221; </p>
<p>Sukriti&#8217;s academic experience has not been confined within the walls of the Pappajohn Business Building on campus. In addition to her business degrees, she also is on track to receive a minor in English. This helps her work as a writing tutor, a role for which she receives scholarship support.</p>
<p>In addition to the compensation she receives for tutoring, Sukriti has benefited from other forms of private support as well. She is the recipient of an Old Gold Tuition Scholarship and the Marion A. Youngers Accounting Ethics Scholarship, and she also has received awards from the Rhodes Dunlap Endowed Hours Fund, the Tippie College of Business Scholarship for Women Fund, and the Dore Business Communications Center/Writing Assistants Fund. </p>
<p>Sukriti regularly expresses her gratitude, with letters of thanks, to those who have made gifts. She also has a message for anyone who is thinking about making a gift, of any amount: &#8220;Sometimes gifts aren&#8217;t as visible, the donations not as flashy. But they all add up,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Gifts show commitment to excellence in education, and they give people an opportunity to pursue that excellence. People who give are creating a whole fleet of young professionals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks to the support she&#8217;s received and the academic achievement she&#8217;s enjoyed, Sukriti can soon count herself among those young professionals. With graduation on the horizon in May 2012, Sukriti already has secured a job in Chicago, working with a transaction service advisory where she&#8217;ll use her accounting skills to advise on mergers and acquisitions. </p>
<p>Sukriti believes that she and her classmates have been successful at Iowa because of what she calls its &#8220;human capital&#8221;&#8212;the connections with peers and mentors, the wisdom and advice from various faculty members, and the opportunities for global experience. </p>
<p>&#8220;We succeed with a sense of community,&#8221; she says.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/sara-langlas.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="sara-langlas" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>To pursue her interest in business, Sarah Langlas considered schools all over the country. But she was raised a Hawkeye fan by her father and other relatives who attended The University of Iowa, and Sarah wanted to be part of the tradition. </p>
<p>From the moment she stepped onto campus, the University of Iowa Henry B. Tippie College of Business student from Wheaton, Illinois, has benefited from private support in ways she hadn’t anticipated. Sarah has built a network of peers and business professionals through the Tippie Scholar program and presentations coordinated by the Young Alumni Board. She has received writing and resume assistance through the Judith R. Frank Business Communications Center and guidance from a program checklist plan that helps students in different majors get on the right track early. </p>
<p>These resources help Sarah, who is on the UI varsity soccer team, efficiently manage her time and prepare for the business world she’ll enter after graduation. </p>
<p>Sarah is grateful to the generous alumni and friends who enable her to take advantage of so many diverse resources. “The more program variety the Tippie College of Business can offer, the more students will get involved and contribute,” says Sarah, a recipient of the Old Gold and Heritage Scholarships, who wants to attend graduate school after working for several years. “Every little bit of support can create something new.” </p>

		<description><![CDATA["Having scholarship money meant I didn't need as rigorous a work schedule outside of school."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/ryan-bentzinger1.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="ryan-bentzinger" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Ryan Bentzinger (2011 B.A.)&#8212;like many before him&#8212;was initially drawn to the University of Iowa by the richness of its writing tradition. While the Pella, Iowa native did not end up pursuing writing academically, he noticed instantly the larger arts tradition present at the UI, and knew he wanted to be a part of it. </p>
<p>&#8220;Iowa City is so open-minded and supportive of the arts,&#8221; says Ryan. &#8220;The relationship between the city and the university is so important.&#8221; </p>
<p>Ryan graduated in May of 2011 with a bachelor&#8217;s degree in studio arts from the University of Iowa College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, and a K-12 teaching certification from the University of Iowa College of Education. Getting to that point was not always easy, Ryan says, and he credits the teachers at the UI&#8212;from teaching assistants to professors&#8212;for creating the opportunities he seized upon in pursuit of his degree. </p>
<p>&#8220;The teachers all care so much about what they&#8217;re doing,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Students can get as much out of the experience as they want.&#8221; </p>
<p>Ryan&#8217;s own experiences were facilitated in part by the financial assistance he received&#8212;as the Belin-Blank Honors Award recipient, and as the recipient of a UI tuition scholarship for his senior year. </p>
<p>&#8220;Having scholarship money meant I didn&#8217;t need as rigorous a work schedule outside of school,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I had time to produce artwork in my free time instead of having to work a nightshift for extra money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Financial support also freed Ryan up to be on the giving end of philanthropy, volunteering hundreds of hours to local schools while a UI student. Practicing his craft and giving of himself are, he believes, ways of thanking his supporters.</p>
<p>&#8220;The best way to show thanks is through success, to prove my supporters right,&#8221; Ryan says. &#8220;Financial support opens doors, and doesn&#8217;t just get you into the game, but ahead of it.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/mark-maryjo-abbott.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="mark-maryjo-abbott" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>For Iowa Hawkeye football fans, Mark Abbott&#8217;s voice is a familiar one&#8212;he&#8217;s the announcer for the games at Kinnick Stadium. But he and his wife, Mary Jo, have another important role as <strong>a voice for UI parents and their children</strong>.</p>
<p>Mark and Mary Jo, whose daughter, Leslie, is a UI senior majoring in Spanish and elementary and secondary education, are contributors to the Parents Fund for Student Support, which provides <strong>resources for vital student-centered projects throughout campus</strong>.</p>
<p>They are also members of the Parents Association&#8217;s board of directors, helping to guide the group&#8217;s work on behalf of other UI parents.</p>
<p>&#8220;All UI parents are automatically members of the Parents Association,&#8221; Mark points out. &#8220;<strong>We help the UI provide safe and fun activities and programs</strong> that go beyond what the UI itself is able to do, especially in these tight budget times.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Parents Fund for Student Support is instrumental in enabling those efforts. </p>
<p>&#8220;The board directs Parents Fund resources toward programs that we think will have <strong>maximum positive impact on students&#8217; lives</strong>,&#8221; Mary Jo says. &#8220;Often, initiatives need seed money to give them the chance to prove themselves. Other times, programs are well established and we want to see them continue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary Jo, who earned a B.S. degree in pharmacy from the UI in 1971 and works as a pharmacist at UI Hospitals and Clinics, and Mark, a 1973 UI law graduate who works as an assistant to the director of athletics at the UI, like to <strong>be involved in the lives of their children and the University</strong>. </p>
<p>&#8220;We learned a lot from the UI. We believe in being advocates for the University,&#8221; Mark says. &#8220;And we were always involved in our kids&#8217; activities in high school, so <strong>contributing to the Parents Fund</strong> and taking an active role in the Parents Association seemed like a natural extension of that.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an easy and effective way to help students have the best possible UI experience.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/rachel-revelez.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="rachel-revelez" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Growing up in West Liberty, Iowa, Rachel Revelez remembers traveling with her family to Iowa City on most weekends. During each of those trips, Rachel&#8217;s parents would point out the University of Iowa campus, telling her she would &#8220;go there someday.&#8221;</p>
<p>Years later, she did exactly that. </p>
<p>Now a junior majoring in elementary education in the UI College of Education, the pieces of campus that once zipped past the window of her family&#8217;s car have become Rachel&#8217;s daily surroundings—and she knows she&#8217;s in the right place.</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t have imagined going anywhere else—it wouldn&#8217;t have felt right,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Rachel is the recipient of the 2012 Edgar M. and Evelyn Benzler Tanruther Scholarship, which was established through the estate of Edgar Tanruther and is awarded to elementary education students. The scholarship will help Rachel offset the costs of pursuing her degree. &#8220;I was awarded the scholarship right around the time I was running out of money to pay off my U-Bill,&#8221; Rachel said. &#8220;It meant a lot to me to get that scholarship at just the right time; it almost felt like someone was looking out for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>During her time on campus, Rachel has done plenty of looking out for others as well, practicing the kind of philanthropy she feels fortunate to have received. As a peer leader in Iowa Edge—an early orientation program for minority and first-generation college students—she gives of her time to enhance the college experience of others. Rachel was a mentee in the program when she arrived on campus, and describes the experience as &#8220;life-changing.&#8221; She credits the program with helping her succeed as a UI student—success she&#8217;s thrilled to foster in others.</p>
<p>&#8220;Being a peer leader for Iowa Edge has definitely been one of my most shining moments here at the university,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Rachel also has received an Advantage Iowa Scholarship and a tuition scholarship through the UI Office of Student Financial Aid. She says the various forms of support she has received have helped her succeed, and she hopes future donors will look at stories like hers and realize the impact they can have.</p>
<p>&#8220;Being a donor means so much because the difference you make is tangible,&#8221; she said. &#8220;What can mean more than that?&#8221; </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/rachel-crome.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="rachel-crome" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Gifts from generous UI alumni and friends have benefited Rachel Crome personally and, in return, contributed to her ability to help others. </p>
<p>Rachel, a student in the University of Iowa College of Engineering, has served on the fundraising committee for the University of Iowa Society of Women Engineers, participated in Habitat for Humanity, and helped organize a 5K “fun run” to benefit the Johnson County Shelter House. This involvement was possible because she received the Lichtenberg Scholarship, which allowed her to focus on her studies and volunteerism rather than working to make ends meet. </p>
<p>The scholarship was also an essential component in the Stockton, Illinois, native’s decision to attend the UI. The manageable size of the UI campus, combined with the resources and opportunities available at other large institutions, also attracted Rachel. </p>
<p>Some of the resources within the college that have been particularly beneficial, and a direct impact of gift support, are the student group activities work space and a new computer lab in the Seamans Center. The group work space provides a communal location for engineering students to complete team projects and hone their technical skills with new, easy-to-use equipment. And the new computer lab, which Rachel uses three times a week, has eased crowding. </p>
<p>Rachel is thankful for the support that comes from those whom she has never met. “It’s hard to give money to someone whose face you’ve never seen,” says Rachel, who plans to work at an environmentally friendly company after graduation. “I’m in awe of that kind of generosity.” </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/Nia-Aitaoto1.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="Nia-Aitaoto" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>For Ph.D. student Nia Aitaoto, the Aloha spirit of her home state of Hawaii can also be found in Iowa. </p>
<p>&#8220;The University of Iowa is special,&#8221; says Nia. &#8220;People are very humble and nice, and I really appreciate that about Iowa.&#8221;</p>
<p>After completing her undergraduate and graduate studies in community health at the University of Hawaii in Manoa, Nia coordinated health programs in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands for nearly a decade before coming to the UI to pursue a Ph.D. in Public Health with a concentration in health communication. </p>
<p>Nia was recently awarded a prestigious R21 grant from the National Institutes of Health to study diabetes prevention in Hawaii and the U.S. Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Being here at The University of Iowa enabled me to easily find faculty experts for my research team,&#8221; says Nia. &#8220;The relationships between the colleges here are so strong that I was able to assemble this great group of people without having to go beyond the University.&#8221; </p>
<p>Gifts from alumni and friends are crucial to Nia&#8217;s UI student experience not only because they support top-notch faculty. She also received the college&#8217;s Dean&#8217;s Fellowship.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could never repay donors for what they&#8217;ve given, but I&#8217;ll do my best to give to the next generation,&#8221; Nia says. &#8220;In my culture, when someone gives you something, it&#8217;s a responsibility. Now I&#8217;m responsible for that gift.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/medicine1.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="College of Medicine" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>The reputation of the University of Iowa Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Science program first piqued Cedar Rapids, Iowa, native Natalia Lawson&#8217;s interest in it. She had heard about the quality of the program, and about how well prepared its graduates were for work in their field upon graduation. And while that has proven true for her in her time in the program, she found something else she loved when she arrived on campus, something harder to measure but every bit as important.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a great community atmosphere here,&#8221; said Natalia. </p>
<p>That sense of community&#8212;on campus and off—has helped Natalia and her classmates take their learning beyond the classroom, a must in a field like physical therapy. Natalia works in a hospital, in addition to her studies, and also volunteers her time through local Elder Services, Incorporated, as an in-home visitor to elderly clients. &#8220;It&#8217;s all about expanding your horizons,&#8221; Natalia said of the UI community. &#8220;I&#8217;m very happy here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Natalia came to the UI after completing undergraduate studies at the University of Northern Iowa. Originally a special-education major, Natalia&#8217;s eyes were opened to the possibilities of physical therapy while she was an undergraduate. Now in her second year at the UI, Natalia isn&#8217;t sure what her focus will be within the field of physical therapy, but she is sure that the experiences she&#8217;ll have within the program will help her sort that out.</p>
<p>As the recipient of scholarships from the School of Physical Therapy and the Roy J. and Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine, Natalia is thankful for the private support she has received. </p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not enough I can say in the way of thanks,&#8221; said Natalia. &#8220;It&#8217;s so meaningful that someone would be willing to help us get this experience and this education. I&#8217;m amazed that people are willing to do that.&#8221; </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/public-health1.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="College of Public Health" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>&#8220;Just a decade ago, the UI College of Public Health didn&#8217;t even exist. Today, I&#8217;m amazed at the quality and range of education and research opportunities that it offers. Private contributions are important to this growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a student pursuing a Master of Public Health for Practicing Veterinarians degree—a collaborative program between the UI and Iowa State University—Morgan Siegrist looks forward to combining her passion for animals with an interest in public health and safety. </p>
<p>Private gifts help make this innovative program possible by providing faculty support to attract and retain a broad range of public health experts, and program support to provide the technology enabling students like Morgan to take some of her UI classes online. Thanks to alumni and friends of the College of Public Health, today’s public health students will become the professionals who ensure our safety tomorrow.</p>

		<description><![CDATA["Your gift makes a strong statement about the importance of mentoring and empowering the next generation."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/morgan-fulmer.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="Morgan Fulmer" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Kansas native Morgan Fulmer grew up with a passion for science. After completing her undergraduate studies at the University of Kansas, that interest put the University of Iowa on her radar. Now in her second year in the University of Iowa Roy J. and Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine Physician Assistant Program, Morgan couldn’t be happier with her choice.</p>
<p>&#8220;The strength of the program drew me here,&#8221; said Morgan. &#8220;But when I first toured, it was the students that really sold it for me. I&#8217;m incredibly happy with my choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to loving science, Morgan also loves working with people. She has found plenty of opportunities to connect with people while participating in the McCowen Learning Community—where she is the Donations Committee sub-chair on the Philanthropy Committee—and serving on the Student Leadership Committee within her college. This past fall, she journeyed to India to work in various clinics with underserved populations.</p>
<p>While others are already benefiting from her own philanthropic work, Morgan has found herself on the receiving end of philanthropy as well. The recipient of the Physician Assistant Departmental Grant, a University of Iowa Foundation Departmental Grant, and the Rex Montgomery Biochemistry Award, Morgan says private financial support was part of what sealed her decision to attend the UI.</p>
<p>&#8220;The University of Iowa was my first choice anyway,&#8221; Morgan said. &#8220;But the financial support was really crucial in allowing me to come here. I would not have had the means to do so otherwise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Due to graduate in May 2012, Morgan isn&#8217;t sure what her focus will be for her career search. She is interested in neurology, oncology, and internal medicine, but she is keeping an open mind. Armed with the experiences she&#8217;s had at Iowa—and that same passion for science that first drew her to the UI campus—a bright future awaits Morgan and her patients.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/Megan-Danforth.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="Megan-Danforth" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Growing up in Shenandoah, Iowa, Megan Danforth (2007 B.S.) always knew she wanted a career in the health-care field. A mentor and family friend helped her decide dentistry was the right field for her. And Megan, who also did her undergraduate studies in Biology at Iowa, said the decision to continue her studies at Iowa was an easy decision to make. </p>
<p>&#8220;Iowa&#8217;s dental college is one of the top in the nation,&#8221; says Megan. &#8220;The reputation of the program, combined with in-state tuition—in my mind there was no better choice!&#8221;</p>
<p>Megan is reassured every day that she’s on the right career path. And she&#8217;s grateful for the private donations that support facilities like the college&#8217;s simulation clinic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right away we learn by doing,&#8221; says Megan of the simulation clinic. &#8220;It&#8217;s one of the best qualities of Iowa&#8217;s program—you get tools in your hands right away to develop those important hand skills.&#8221;</p>
<p>After graduation, Megan plans to settle in small-town Iowa to practice dentistry. And the financial support she&#8217;s received while in school will allow her to do that.</p>
<p>&#8220;We realize that sometimes alumni and friends aren&#8217;t here to see the fruits of their giving, but I hope they know that it relieves a lot of the stress of our day-to-day work. So thank you!&#8221;</p>

		<description><![CDATA["I wanted to come to Iowa because when I came to visit, I felt really welcome. But if I didn't have these scholarships, I would've had to stay in Illinois for school."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="302" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/Maribel-Treto.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="Maribel Treto" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>In high school, Maribel Treto realized she had special skills in the areas of science and math, and decided to study engineering at The University of Iowa after an exciting college visit day.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came on the day of an Iowa vs. Iowa State football game,&#8221; says Maribel. &#8220;Students were decked out in black and gold, and everyone was very welcoming and full of school spirit.&#8221;</p>
<p>The senior chemical engineering major, who hails from Melrose Park, Illinois, is happy with her decision to come to The University of Iowa. </p>
<p>&#8220;The College of Engineering is small, it&#8217;s personal,&#8221; says Maribel. &#8220;I really know my professors, and they know me by name.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is especially important to the first-generation college student.</p>
<p>&#8220;I definitely have the support of my family; they know college is important,&#8221; says Maribel. &#8220;But when it comes to academic requirements or what to expect during my college career, I&#8217;ve had to rely on my professors and advisor for that information. And they’ve been really helpful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Private support has been crucial to Maribel’s college experience. She received an Advantage Iowa scholarship, a merit-based award given to students who will contribute to a diverse learning environment, and an Alcoa Scholarship for Diverse Engineering Students. </p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to come to Iowa because when I came to visit, I felt really welcome,&#8221; says Maribel. &#8220;But if I didn&#8217;t have these scholarships, I would&#8217;ve had to stay in Illinois for school,&#8221; she notes, adding that out-of-state tuition would have been a financial burden for her family.</p>
<p>Gifts from UI alumni and friends enabled her to focus on academics and gain practical experience doing internships, including one with Schlumberger, an oilfield services provider in Alaska. </p>
<p>Maribel looks forward to working in her chosen career after graduating in May 2011. She also hopes to be able to give back to the UI. &#8220;I want to share with others and help them grow.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/athletics1.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="athletics" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p><strong>Kelsey Cermak</strong>, an Iowa Hawkeye forward from Norwalk, Iowa, was recruited by several colleges, including the University of Northern Iowa and the University of Nebraska. But none of them had a chance. “I grew up a Hawkeye fan,” Kelsey says. “It wasn’t a hard choice. Being a Hawkeye was always my ultimate goal.”</p>
<p>Being offered a scholarship clinched the deal. “It means a lot,” she says. “Coach Bluder gave me a chance. I’m thankful every day. I’ll look back on it as a great experience for the rest of my life.”</p>
<p>The Hawkeyes are just as thankful to have Kelsey, a communications major who was an academic all-Big Ten honoree in her sophomore and junior years, wearing the black and gold. She has been a solid contributor to her team both on the court and off. Her selection as the recipient of the team&#8217;s <strong>Dr. Christine Grant Leadership Award</strong> and the <strong>Kris Rogers Memorial Scholarship</strong> speaks volumes about the respect she’s earned among her fellow student-athletes and her coaches.</p>
<p>Kelsey’s scholarship support during her four years at Iowa has also included the Bill and Kay Pitlik Women’s Basketball Scholarship and support from the Colloton Fund for Women’s Athletics. During the summer of 2010, Kelsey traveled to I-Club golf outings and lunches as an intern at The University of Iowa Foundation, so she knows well the importance of scholarship support from Hawkeye fans. “We wouldn’t be here without them,” she points out.</p>
<p>She also is grateful for the support that UI alumni and friends have shown for the Carver-Hawkeye Arena renovation project. Though she won’t see the results as a player, she knows just how crucial it will be to the success of those who follow in her footsteps.</p>
<p>“They’ll be able to go in whenever they want to practice,” she says. “They won’t have to schedule around other teams. The weight room and locker rooms will be up to date. It will be a huge help with recruiting, and will really help the coaches.”</p>
<p>Kelsey sums up her gratitude for Iowa Athletics supporters succinctly: “Being a Hawkeye has been the best experience I’ve ever had—and you’re part of the reason why.” </p>

		<description><![CDATA["I’m glad for the opportunity to be in a great program like REACH."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/kelly-nagle.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="kelly-nagle" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>When Kelly Nagle first arrived on the University of Iowa campus, her dream was to someday be an actress or a singer. After one year of classes, her plans have changed dramatically.</p>
<p>&#8220;I realize now that I want to have a more realistic goal,&#8221; says Kelly, who hails from Overland Park, Kansas. &#8220;I want to work with people and help them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kelly, who has Down syndrome, is enrolled in the UI College of Education’s <strong>Realizing Educational and Career Hopes (REACH)</strong> program, a two-year certificate track for young adults with multiple intellectual, cognitive, and learning disabilities. Much of the REACH curriculum is focused on career preparedness, and during the second year, students participate in an internship with a local business.</p>
<p>Through courses centered on career exploration, Kelly has discovered that she enjoys helping people and would like to prepare for a career in elder services. With additional instruction in personal finances, technology, and health and life skills, Kelly is quickly gaining the confidence and problem-solving skills that she hopes will lead to more independence upon graduating from REACH.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’ve learned so much about personal responsibility,&#8221; says Kelly, &#8220;but with tons of support.&#8221; </p>
<p>And though Kelly says it was hard to leave her family, her transition to college went smoothly. She enjoys her classes and fills her weekends with a variety of on- and off-campus activities.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like living in the residence halls,&#8221; says Kelly. &#8220;And it’s fun meeting new people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kelly’s advisor, Janis Mendenhall, has enjoyed watching Kelly adjust to campus life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kelly has done really well with meeting new people, and quickly made friends with students in and out of the REACH program,&#8221; says Janis. &#8220;She’s doing well here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kelly’s mother, Mimi, agrees. </p>
<p>&#8220;I thought Kelly was pretty independent and mature when she went to school,&#8221; says Mimi. &#8220;But when she came home for Christmas break she had such confidence, and her problem-solving skills had really improved. She really works at things on her own now before coming to us for help.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Mimi is thrilled for Kelly to have this opportunity and is grateful for gifts to the REACH Fund. </strong></p>
<p>&#8220;When we started this process, I was surprised at the lack of federal assistance for students with intellectual disabilities,&#8221; says Mimi. &#8220;So private support has been extremely helpful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kelly is looking forward to her internship and plans to find a job in Iowa City after graduation. </p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s wonderful here,&#8221; says Kelly. &#8220;This has been an opportunity of a lifetime. I’m glad for the opportunity to be in a great program like REACH.&#8221;</p>

		<description><![CDATA["Your assistance and devotion to the University of Iowa has been felt on a personal level."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/kayla-pollock.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="Kayla Pollock" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>From a town of not quite 700 to a campus of more than 30,000, Kayla Pollock (B.A. 2010) expected many things to change when she chose to leave home and attend the University of Iowa. </p>
<p>&#8220;Coming from a very small town, I was used to having a tight-knit community of support around me at all times,&#8221; says Kayla. But thanks to the support she has received at the UI, that small-town feeling hasn&#8217;t been as elusive on campus as she had expected.</p>
<p>The philanthropy of donors—people who, in Kayla&#8217;s case, she has never met—plays a large role in that community feel. &#8220;Receiving financial support from people I&#8217;d never even met reminded me a lot of the camaraderie of my small town,&#8221; says Kayla. </p>
<p>If the small-town camaraderie of campus surprised Kayla, the quality of UI academics did not. Two older siblings preceded her to campus, and their experiences—coupled with the UI&#8217;s &#8220;esteemed liberal arts background&#8221;—were enough to pique her interest when she began considering colleges. Iowa City&#8217;s designation as an international &#8220;City of Literature&#8221; by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) during Kayla&#8217;s time on campus has only bolstered the value of her UI education, she says.</p>
<p>Kayla graduated from the UI in 2010 with a bachelor&#8217;s degree in English. She married shortly after graduation and chose to remain in the area—an &#8220;easy decision,&#8221; she says, for her and her husband—to pursue a master&#8217;s degree in Library and Information Science and a K-12 Iowa teaching certification at the UI. Her decision was further validated when she was awarded the Gladys and Margaret Harvey Education Scholarship by the University of Iowa College of Education in 2012.</p>
<p>The scholarship was established by Margaret Harvey in memory of her sister, Gladys Harvey, and is awarded to undergraduate or graduate students in the College of Education. Receiving the scholarship reduced Kayla&#8217;s financial stress, allowing her to concentrate more fully on student teaching in the fall of 2012. Although she did not get the chance to meet her benefactor, Kayla knows what she would say to her if she could.</p>
<p>&#8220;Donations are so much more than simple transactions,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Your assistance and devotion to the University of Iowa has been felt on a personal level, which is something that is not always easy in an institution of this size.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/Kapri-Saunders.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="Kapri-Saunders" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>When Kapri Saunders started looking at law schools, she took out a map of the United States, and crossed out all the states she would never live in. </p>
<p>&#8220;Iowa was one of them,&#8221; Kapri laughs. </p>
<p>But then she met someone who had attended the College of Law at The University of Iowa, and he raved about the program and Iowa City. After researching the program, she included UI in her application process and eventually chose Iowa. She made the move from Tempe, Arizona, and hasn&#8217;t looked back. &#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine having gone to law school anywhere else,&#8221; she says. </p>
<p>Kapri, who completed her undergraduate studies at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, has settled in well in Iowa City. She&#8217;s currently editor-in-chief of the <i>Journal of Gender, Race and Justice</i>, which is a donor-supported publication now in its 15th year. And Kapri has been thrilled with the opportunities private support to the law school has afforded her, including work in the college&#8217;s Clinical Law Programs where she&#8217;s able to work on real family law and immigration cases under the supervision of law faculty. </p>
<p>After graduating in May, Kapri will move to Cleveland, where she will clerk for a federal district court judge in the Northern District of Ohio. </p>
<p>&#8220;There are so many people who have given and have helped me succeed,&#8221; says Kapri. &#8220;The best I can do is say &#8216;thank you,&#8217; and then go do good in the world.&#8221;</p>

		<description><![CDATA["Donors start a chain reaction by supporting graduate students who as teaching assistant support me and help me discover my passions. "]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/kaitlyn-kemna.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="kaitlyn-kemna" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Kaitlyn Kemna was very nervous when she arrived at The University of Iowa for the start of classes, but special interactions with teachers assured her that she had chosen an extraordinary university.</p>
<p>Kaitlyn graduated from a high school class of just 57 in Mason City, Iowa. She initially wanted to go to a small university, but family members who had attended the UI encouraged Kaitlyn to challenge herself. </p>
<p>Early in Kaitlyn’s sophomore year, her sister was diagnosed with kidney disease, and it was determined that Kaitlyn would be the donor. It was remarkable, Kaitlyn said, how understanding and accommodating her teachers were during that period, before they even knew her. “It sounds cheesy,” says Kaitlyn, “but I’m really not a number here.” </p>
<p> In addition to giving each student a personalized experience, the UI recognizes that students need flexibility in determining their areas of study. A teaching assistant helped Kaitlyn, who began as a biology major, realize she enjoyed history much more. “I’m appreciative that I was able to actively explore different areas of interest,” says Kaitlyn. </p>
<p>The key role that donors have in supporting teachers, like the ones that had such a positive influence on Kaitlyn, has opened Kaitlyn’s eyes to the importance of giving. She was inspired to become involved with the Student Philanthropy Group, an organization on campus that informs students about the importance of philanthropy and the ways donors’ gifts of all sizes touch so many aspects of the university experience. </p>
<p>Because of her experiences and involvement with the philanthropy group, Kaitlyn firmly decided to become a donor herself one day. She looks forward to being a part of making students’ time at Iowa well-rounded and exceptional. “I don’t know many people who wouldn’t want to be part of that,” says Kaitlyn. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/julie-qidwai.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="julie-qidwai" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Julie Qidwai knows a good library when she sees one. The Cedar Falls, Iowa, native and graduate student in industrial engineering grew up around libraries. And she couldn&#8217;t be happier with the ways the UI Libraries network&#8212;with the help of its generous contributors&#8212;has enabled her to conduct research through its <strong>varied, user-friendly services</strong>. </p>
<p>Julie&#8217;s father is the archivist at a university library and her mother, a university instructor, has a degree in library science. Now Julie finds herself immersed in <strong>the finer points of a university library</strong>.</p>
<p>As a researcher at the UI&#8217;s National Advanced Driving Simulator, studying the effects of alcohol and drugs on driving behavior, Julie&#8212;who earned a B.S. degree in psychology from the UI in 1999&#8212;says, &#8220;I use the Libraries&#8217; online services almost every day. I use InfoHawk to find out whether the University possesses publications I need. Being able to access online full-text versions of recent versions of many journals has been a godsend.&#8221;</p>
<p>She adds, &#8220;If the Libraries don&#8217;t have what I need, I can submit a request to Interlibrary Loan, where they do their very best to find my citations, even when the details are lacking. The Libraries&#8217; Government Publications department has also ordered a number of reports from the Department of Transportation for me to use.</p>
<p>&#8220;In short,&#8221; says Julie, &#8220;I barely have to leave my desk, which allows me to spend <strong>more time analyzing than searching</strong>. Thanks!&#8221; </p>
<p>From extensive collections to excellent service, <strong>the University Libraries system has it all</strong>, thanks in large part to thoughtful and loyal contributors. And as Julie makes clear, the Libraries system helps make the work of UI community members&#8212;undergraduate and graduate students as well as faculty and staff&#8212;possible. </p>

		<description><![CDATA["Those gifts have been so impactful on my education. Higher education opens so many doors, and without private support, those doors would be closed for some."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/jostten-sackitey.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="Jostten Sackitey" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Jostten Sackitey had only a stretch of interstate between his birth home and the University of Iowa. However, when his family moved from Des Moines to Philadelphia, Pa., after he was born, the miles grew, and the road meandered. He didn&#8217;t know then that he would one day return to Iowa to finish out high school&#8212;and to attend the University of Iowa. </p>
<p>He has never regretted that move.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to imagine having a better time or getting more out of the experience than I have,&#8221; said Jostten. </p>
<p>Jostten&#8217;s first love was in the sciences, and his initial exposure to the UI campus was during a glaucoma-research program he participated in during the summer after his senior year in high school. He saw a wealth of opportunity awaiting him during that experience.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was attracted to Iowa because it had the broadest, deepest resources and expertise in the areas I was interested in,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Now a double major in economics and finance in the Henry B. Tippie College of Business, Jostten has discovered that this breadth and depth extends well beyond the sciences. Through his involvement in the Iowa Edge Program&#8212;an initiative designed to help underrepresented populations transition to college&#8212;as well as several clubs and organizations, Jostten has taken his learning, and his leadership, beyond the classroom. After graduation in May 2012, he will begin work immediately for Google&#8217;s treasury department. </p>
<p>The beneficiary of private support&#8212;with scholarships from the E. Lester and Frances M. Williams Fund and the Earl A. Wimmer Business Scholarship Fund&#8212;Jostten is thankful for the opportunities he has received. </p>
<p>&#8220;Those gifts have been so impactful on my education,&#8221; said Jostten. &#8220;Higher education opens so many doors, and without private support, those doors would be closed for some.&#8221; </p>
<p>In fact, he plans to help open doors for others someday. &#8220;It&#8217;s only right that I do someone else the favor,&#8221; said Jostten.</p>

		<description><![CDATA["I’m grateful to alumni for continuing the legacy of giving that started when they were in school, and I’m happy to carry it on for another generation."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/johnathan-gadjos.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="Johnathan Gadjos" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>There is something special, says Johnathan Gajdos, about the University of Iowa Graduate College in that it is committed to excellence in a wide range of disciplines. </p>
<p>The excellence in the Department of German drew Johnathan to the UI after completing his undergraduate studies at Georgetown University. Upon his first visit, he was impressed with the people he met on campus as well as by the University’s facilities. </p>
<p> That positive impression hasn’t faded six years later thanks to funding from generous alumni and friends that has enhanced Johnathan’s time at the UI. Johnathan was awarded the Presidential Graduate Fellowship, which allowed him to concentrate on research and his dissertation without needing to make ends meet by teaching undergraduates during each year of study. The fellowship included four summers of support in which he studied linguistics at a Linguistic Society of America Institute at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and learned Swedish in Sweden. </p>
<p> Private support also funds the annual James F. Jakobsen Graduate Conference, which provides an opportunity for graduate students like Johnathan to present their research and work, and be recognized for their efforts, right on campus. </p>
<p>Johnathan, who grew up outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is grateful to those who make these experiences available. He is so confident in the Graduate College’s use of funds that he has already begun his own legacy of giving at the University. </p>
<p>“I know my small contribution doesn’t make a huge difference, but I want to start somewhere,” says Johnathan. “It’s a symbol of my support and trust in the Graduate College’s awareness of students’ needs and wants.” </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/jessica-orseno.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="Jessica Orseno" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>In the midst of her major Midwest college tour, Jessica Orseno came across an interview with an alumna of The University of Iowa in her local newspaper. In response to being asked what her favorite city was, the interviewee said, “Iowa City. Hands down.” </p>
<p>This sparked an interest in Jessica. When she subsequently visited Iowa City, Jessica felt comfortable immediately. The compactness of such a large university, positive interactions with current University of Iowa Henry B. Tippie College of Business students and the opportunity for several scholarships sealed Jessica’s decision to become a Hawkeye.</p>
<p>As an accounting student from Homer Glen, Ill., set to graduate in May 2011, Jessica has had the chance to spend two weeks studying international environmental business in London with fellow Tippie College of Business students and has been involved with Beta Alpha Psi, an honors accounting fraternity that provides professional development for students while emphasizing community service. </p>
<p>In addition to these opportunities, private funding supports and retains exceptional faculty members who have pushed Jessica beyond getting good grades to developing an intuition for accounting concepts and interacting with the management teams of local businesses. </p>
<p>Jessica is grateful for the many teachers at Iowa who have helped her excel, and for the gifts from generous individuals that support them and enhance the university experience. “Private gifts allow students to advance beyond what the classroom can offer, making us more marketable, involved and well-rounded people,” says Jessica. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="301" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/jen-lee.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="jen-lee" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Private scholarship support gave Jenna LeRoy the freedom to decide her medical specialty based on the most important criteria: how much she enjoys the work. This means a lot to Jenna when she considers the possibility of choosing other specialties with shorter degree-completion periods just so she could quickly pay back her loans. </p>
<p>Jenna came to The University of Iowa from Clinton, Iowa, to take advantage of a first-class, in-state institution. She received a bachelor’s degree from the UI in 2007 before continuing on at the University of Iowa Roy J. and Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine. </p>
<p>The physicians at Iowa are a source of constant inspiration to Jenna, who plans to pursue a pediatric residency after graduation. She has great respect for those who strive to continue learning about the changing field of medicine while maintaining superior patient care. Jenna intends to thank those who contribute to the annual fund each year by dedicating herself to becoming a great physician like those she’s encountered at Iowa. </p>
<p>“My scholarship meant that this school has faith in my abilities,” says Jenna, who received the Medicine General Scholarship, a product of annual giving, in addition to several other scholarships. “Knowing this makes me work harder so that I can honor the UI’s belief in me and the generosity of the people who made such a wonderful gift.”</p>

<p>Vandenberg has been a quarterback since the first grade, when he fell in love with the game of football. He has been a Hawkeye fan since he was ten years old, when his parents, Ann and Toby, moved to Keokuk from Washington State. </p>
<p>“Having a scholarship to attend this University is a huge privilege, and something I take very seriously,” said Vandenberg, who is studying integrated physiology at the UI. “It is something I am thankful for every day, because Iowa football and the Falb family (James is the recipient of the <b>Mark Falb Quarterback Scholarship</b>) are giving me a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, in both academics and athletics. I am very grateful to them.”</p>
<p>Vandenberg’s appreciation for private support and the important role it plays for so many student-athletes only deepened when he worked as an intern at the UI Foundation in the summer of 2011.</p>
<p>Vandenberg said, “The internship was an awesome job opportunity, and an eye-opening experience. I couldn’t believe how much donors have given to support student-athletes. Not only has it given me a deeper sense of gratitude for the support I’ve received, it has also made me look forward to being a donor some day &#8211; and passing it on.”</p>
<p>Executive Director of Development at the UI Foundation, Matt Henderson, said “We’ve had a long line of impressive student-athletes intern with us, and James was no different. He was wonderful with our donors. He has such a genuine appreciation of people and their passion for the Hawks that he draws people in. He truly feels it is an honor to be a Hawkeye, and shows sincere generosity with his time. He is an ideal representative of our student-athletes and I know that Mark (Falb) is very proud of his association with James.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/jacob-shell.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="jacob-shell" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>A high-school job in a drugstore in his hometown of Spirit Lake, Iowa, first sparked Jacob Shell&#8217;s interest in becoming a pharmacist. In that job, he saw pharmacists interacting with the public&#8212;and building relationships&#8212;and he knew he wanted to do the same. </p>
<p>&#8220;I saw how those relationships affected the patients&#8217; overall health care,&#8221; Jacob said. &#8220;I wanted to be that accessible to people.&#8221; </p>
<p>Jacob now is a third-year student in the University of Iowa College of Pharmacy, and he was drawn to the school because of its strong national reputation. Since arriving at Iowa, he has seen for himself how the college has earned that reputation, and he has benefited from the plentiful opportunities for students to get involved.</p>
<p>Jacob seized one such opportunity through service in the College of Pharmacy Student Leadership Council, an organization for which he now serves as president. As part of this role, Jacob serves on the Iowa Pharmacy Association Trustees, and he also assists with the college&#8217;s various community outreach efforts.</p>
<p>With plans to graduate in May 2013, Jacob isn&#8217;t certain where his career path might lead. He likes the idea of working in a small community pharmacy like the one in his hometown, and he thinks he might like to try his hand at management down the road. He&#8217;s hoping his last year in the program will help him decide.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope my rotations help shed some light on that for me,&#8221; Jacob said in describing the field experiences he&#8217;ll have in his final year. </p>
<p>He is grateful for the private support that has helped him make the most of his opportunities at Iowa, and he &#8220;absolutely&#8221; plans to &#8220;pay it forward&#8221; one day by giving back to others&#8212;and to his alma mater.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/jacob-kirpes.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="jacob-kirpes" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Jacob Kirpes has never regretted his decision to attend the University of Iowa. </p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no other place for me to be,&#8221; said Jacob. &#8220;It&#8217;s become a home for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Des Moines native considered other places to pursue his college goals, but ultimately chose the UI in part because of the private support that awaited him. Jacob is the recipient of the William C. Power, Jr., Scholarship, an R. Milton Pierce Memorial Scholarship, and an award from the James R. Whiteley Grand Challenges Scholar Fund, a three-year program focusing on interdisciplinary studies. In summer 2011, Jacob also received the Ann Morse Study-Abroad Scholarship, an award that facilitated a study-abroad experience in Italy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be here without donors and the scholarships they provide,&#8221; Jacob said. &#8220;Without them, I wouldn&#8217;t be on this track.&#8221;</p>
<p>That track includes an ambitious double major: industrial engineering in the College of Engineering and finance in the Henry B. Tippie College of Business. When he graduates in December 2013, he hopes to pursue a career in supply-chain finance. </p>
<p>Jacob credits his academic success to a faculty that fully engages students. He also credits facilities such as the Engineering Building, within which he has had the opportunity to learn and network with peers. </p>
<p>&#8220;The building is so well-kept,&#8221; Jacob said. &#8220;It has great technology, and it&#8217;s a great place to study and hang out with friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>He hopes future students can benefit from private support the same way he has. And he counts himself and his fellow future graduates among those future contributors, thanks to the success they&#8217;ve been able to enjoy at the UI.</p>
<p>&#8220;We look forward to giving back,&#8221; said Jacob. &#8220;That would be rewarding.&#8221;</p>

With those experiences on my résumé, I know I&#8217;ll be successful after graduation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gabe Darrow knows that amazing teachers really can change lives. Thanks to an influential high-school teacher who encouraged him to apply to the Henry B.Tippie College of Business, Gabe has benefited from life-changing UI experiences that include interning at MidWestOne Bank and working for a hedge-fund placement agent in London. &#8220;My classmates and I have had many firsthand experiences like these,&#8221; says Gabe. &#8220;They&#8217;ve taught us that Iowa business students really can compete with the Ivy Leaguers!&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/farah-towfic.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="farah-towfic" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Farah Towfic has donors to the University of Iowa College of Pharmacy to thank for her recent trip to Las Vegas. But Farah wasn’t in the city to gamble. She attended the American Society of Health-Systems Pharmacists Clinical Meeting in December 2009—an invaluable opportunity to strengthen her knowledge and make personal connections with colleagues in her field of choice. </p>
<p>Opportunities like this one make Farah proud to be part of the UI College of Pharmacy. She chose Iowa because she recognized the value in the close relationship the program has with the UI Roy J. and Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine and the Colleges of Dentistry and Public Health, allowing a collective community outreach effort and an interdisciplinary perspective. </p>
<p>Farah will take advantage of this partnership to learn and develop an understanding that will improve the overall health of her future patients. </p>
<p>As a pharmacy student, Farah has also felt the impact of alumni support in other ways. She has been an intern at a community pharmacy, served as a student trustee on the Iowa Pharmacy Association Board of Trustees and benefited from a tuition scholarship. </p>
<p>The student from Dubuque, Iowa, is grateful for every opportunity she’s had. “In the years ahead I know I’ll be following the example of the current alumni by giving to the UI so that students like me can develop professionally and become future leaders,” says Farah. “My gratitude for donors’ support will be demonstrated in the exceptional care I plan to give patients, and the more students who come through this program, that many more patients will benefit.” </p>

When the time came for Erin to decide where to study to become a physical therapist for real, the UI Graduate Program in Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Science&#8217;s reputation as the third-ranked program in the nation made the UI an easy choice. </p>
<p>Gifts from friends and alumni have helped Erin pay her way through school and created great opportunities for her in a first-rate learning environment—and when she&#8217;s providing compassionate, skilled care to her patients, those donors can all take pride in contributing to a healthier society. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/erin-kytola.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="erin-kytola" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>When Des Moines native Erin Kytola visited the University of Iowa campus during her junior year of high school, she fell in love with what she saw on campus. She also fell in love with Iowa&#8217;s opportunities.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t sure about what I wanted to do at that time,&#8221; Erin said. &#8220;And the UI offered the most majors and options for me to explore that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Erin&#8212;now a double major in journalism and ethics and public policy in the School of Journalism and Mass Communication in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, with a minor in business&#8212;credits the freedom she had to explore her interests for making confident academic choices. Those choices led to even more opportunities for Erin, including an internship with the Public Relations Student Society of America. </p>
<p>While such opportunities were a draw for Erin, so too was generous financial support. She received an Old Gold Scholarship, an award that played a role in her decision to attend the UI. She has continued to benefit from private support, receiving the Mark Westerbeck Memorial Scholarship&#8212;presented to her at the Fourth Estate Banquet, where she was able to meet her contributors and thank them in person.</p>
<p>&#8220;Financial help is such a great benefit,&#8221; said Erin. &#8220;Without it, none of my experiences would have been possible.&#8221; </p>
<p>And for Erin, the evidence of private support has gone well beyond scholarship awards. &#8220;We&#8217;re never at want for the technology we need, and it would be hard to get a job after graduation without that experience,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Her hope is that continued private support will provide future students with the opportunities she has enjoyed. She believes the impact of that support extends well beyond what happens on campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;The work done at Iowa&#8217;s journalism school affects the world,&#8221; she said.</p>

		<description><![CDATA["I couldn't have continued at Iowa without private support - and I can't imagine what my life would be like if I hadn't stayed and finished."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/ellie-catton.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="ellie-catton" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p><img src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/ellie-catton-300x187.jpg" align="right" style="padding:0 0 20px 20px;" /></p>
<p>If Ellie Catton’s life were a novel, its words would whisper of wind-swept glaciers in New Zealand and tree-lined boulevards in a small Midwestern city. Its characters would include a cast of talented and fiercely honest writers. And its denouement would happen through a last-minute change of heart—and the power of private support.</p>
<p>That support is what turned chance into good fortune for Ellie, after the New Zealand author came to the University of Iowa Writers’ Workshop—a unit of the UI College of Liberal Arts and Sciences—in 2008.  The 25-year-old novelist, who recently made the short list of nominees for the prestigious Dylan Thomas Prize for her 2008 book, <em>The Rehearsal</em>, was in fine company in the program. Begun in 1936 as the nation’s first creative-writing degree program, the illustrious Iowa Writers’ Workshop is marking its 75th anniversary, with decades’ worth of famous and award-winning poets and authors among its graduates.</p>
<p>One of the first UI students to receive an M.A. degree in creative writing was poet Paul Engle, whose collection, <em>Worn Earth</em>, earned him the Yale Series of Younger Poets Prize. Engle assumed directorship of the Workshop in 1941 and held it for 25 years, during which the program became a literary powerhouse.</p>
<p>This reputation was what drew Ellie—who says she can’t recall a time in her life when she didn’t write—to Iowa. She arrived at the Workshop on a one-year exchange, after completing a master’s degree in creative writing at Victoria University of Wellington. When her Iowa tenure ended, the Workshop’s faculty asked the young novelist to stay on for another year. However, she declined—and was just 10 days away from flying home when she changed her mind.</p>
<p>“I confessed to a Workshop friend that I’d made a terrible mistake. He encouraged me to tell them I wanted to stay, but I thought it was hopeless,” Ellie says.</p>
<p>“When I called, they immediately found funding for me. I couldn’t have continued at Iowa without private support—and I can’t imagine what my life would be like if I hadn’t stayed and finished,” says the 2010 graduate, who received the Flannery O’ Connor Graduate Fellowship—created through a gift commitment from the Ralph Schultz Family Foundation of  Waterloo, Iowa—and the Taylor-Chehak Prize, established by novelist Susan Taylor Chehak and her father, Robert Taylor.</p>
<p>“There is just something sacred about the Workshop,” says Ellie. “While you’re there, you’re saying what you honestly feel, but you’re also conscious of the fact that the author is listening. It’s an interesting psychological exercise.”</p>
<p>Ellie completed her first book on her family’s home computer at age nine and still indulges her childhood fascination with “sentences and syntax.” She currently is teaching at The University of Iowa while “pulling strange all-nighters” to finish her second novel—set in 1860s New Zealand—for <em>Granta</em>, a publisher in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Once it’s done, Ellie hopes to move to Canada to complete a Ph.D. degree in English literature and, perhaps, teach creative writing. No matter where she finds herself, she will carry with her all the words worth remembering from the Iowa Writers’ Workshop. And they will help create the next chapters of her life.</p>

		<description><![CDATA["I've actually been able to cut my expenses with each successive year. And that has allowed me to take advantage of all of the diverse opportunities here."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/elizabeth-schorsch.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="Elizabeth Schorsch" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Elizabeth Schorsch came to the University of Iowa expecting to follow one set path but found herself branching out in new directions once she was here.</p>
<p>&#8220;Originally, I came here for the creative-writing program,&#8221; said the Chicago native. &#8220;Once I was here for a bit, I realized that I no longer wanted to pursue creative writing academically, but I was glad that Iowa is a big school with strong liberal arts so that I could explore my other interest areas.&#8221; </p>
<p>Among those interests were history and education, and Elizabeth has done her share of exploration in each. She is now a double major in history and education policy in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, and she created her latter major herself, with help from the college&#8217;s Department of Interdepartmental Studies.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a pretty unique program that allows driven students who are interested in pursuing a field of study or a career path that isn&#8217;t provided in the traditional departments or colleges to create their own majors,&#8221; Elizabeth said. &#8220;It&#8217;s really a wonderful process that forces you to figure out what it is you really want to pursue for your future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elizabeth&#8217;s college exploration has taken her far beyond campus as well; she spent a month in western Ukraine teaching English for a university. On campus, she works as a writing and rhetoric tutor for her residence-hall tutoring program, and she has acted as a peer mentor for the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. In each of these roles, Elizabeth cites the help she is able to provide for others as motivation.</p>
<p>As the recipient of three scholarships&#8212;the UI National Scholars Award, the Old Gold Scholarship, and the Maxine J. Hibbs Scholarship&#8212;Elizabeth credits private support with transforming her UI experience. </p>
<p>&#8220;Because of that aid, I&#8217;ve actually been able to cut my expenses with each successive year. And that has allowed me to take advantage of all of the diverse opportunities here&#8212;and even do things like go to Ukraine to teach,&#8221; Elizabeth said.</p>
<p>Elizabeth believes the best way to thank contributors is to make the most of the experiences they facilitate with their gifts. And as to whether or not she intends to make gifts of her own down the road, she can answer in one word: &#8220;Definitely,&#8221; she said. </p>

After a mission trip to Gambia, West Africa, following graduation, he was inspired to apply that interest to the need for good health care as a physician assistant. </p>
<p>The University of Iowa Roy J. and Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine’s top-ranked Physician Assistant Program lured him to Iowa City after completing his undergraduate studies at Winona State University in Minnesota. The small class sizes at the UI, excellent instructors and proximity to UI Hospitals and Clinics—all things private support enables—make him proud of his choice. </p>
<p>Denver received the Montgomery Physician Assistant Scholarship his first year in the graduate program. “Giving to this program is a great investment,” Denver says. “Health care is a huge need both in the United States and around the world. Physician assistants play a vital role in satisfying that need.”</p>
<p>After completing his degree, Denver is considering going abroad to spread the knowledge and experience he gained at the UI globally. Wherever he ends up, he’ll have generous alumni and friends to thank for helping him launch the career of his dreams. </p>

I am grateful for the private support that has helped make this possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a nontraditional student, private support has been vitally important for David Osedo. It has allowed him to focus on his studies in the UI Physician Assistant Program—and to complete his clinical rotations—without having to worry about his family&#8217;s financial situation. During one of these clinical rotations in South Dakota, David saw, firsthand, how physician assistants in rural settings change peoples&#8217; lives. And that&#8217;s exactly what he plans to do after graduation.</p>

		<description><![CDATA["For me it's been such a wonderful experience at Iowa, I’ve had such a great time, and it’s expanded my academic horizons."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="301" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/David-Fulcher.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="David-Fulcher" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Involvement in a young investors club during high school sparked an immediate interest in business and finance for David Fulcher, and eventually led him to the University of Iowa Henry B. Tippie College of Business. &#8220;For me it&#8217;s been such a wonderful experience at Iowa, I’ve had such a great time, and it’s expanded my academic horizions,&#8221; says David. </p>
<p>The Finance and Spanish double major has taken full advantage of his college experience. He was president of the Financial Management Association, and is active in Delta Sigma Pi (a co-ed business fraternity), studied abroad in Costa Rica and was a recipient of Tippie’s &#8220;21 Under 21&#8243; award, which goes to the college’s outstanding student leaders. </p>
<p>&#8220;I had the opportunity to meet Mr. Tippie and thank him for all of his support. It was such a gratifying experience,&#8221; David said, referring to the 1949 UI graduate who gave $30 million to support the UI&#8217;s business college that now bears his name. David was also selected as a scholar for the Hawkinson Institute of Business Finance, a donor-funded professional development program that currently boasts nearly 100 percent job placement for its graduates. </p>
<p>David is grateful for all of the opportunities he&#8217;s had at Iowa, and has this to say to his fellow students. &#8220;Mr. Tippie mentioned that his very first gift was five dollars,&#8221; says David. “Any amount helps!&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/daniela-moga.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="Daniela Moga" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Daniela Moga has a straightforward philosophy about private support: &#8220;Education is somebody&#8217;s ride, and it&#8217;s great if you can help them go somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>And she would know. Hailing from Romania, her own ride was long, and was made possible by the financial support she received to attend the University of Iowa.</p>
<p>Daniela&#8217;s first exposure to the UI was on a visit as a Fogerty International Fellow. She knew about Iowa&#8217;s academic reputation, and she found something more on that visit.</p>
<p>&#8220;I fell in love with the place and the people,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Now in her final year as a Ph.D. student in the UI College of Public Health, Daniela was able to begin her journey through the UI by way of a pre-doctoral fellowship. She has since received an E. Peter Isaacson Scholarship, as well as various departmental awards from the College of Public Health. Daniela thanks contributors for allowing her to pursue her academic dreams, but she also expresses gratitude to the larger community for the personal support she’s found.</p>
<p>&#8220;The environment here allows me to be a good mom and a good student,&#8221; Daniela said.</p>
<p>Upon completing her studies in pharmecoepidemiology in May 2012, Daniela would like to continue working in a research capacity. She definitely plans to donate to the UI in the future: &#8220;I will do that. It allows people to pursue dreams, and it changes people&#8217;s lives.&#8221; </p>
<p>And as to what she would say to the contributors who helped pave her own road through the UI, Daniela has another simple message: &#8220;Thank you for changing my life.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/daniel-pelzer.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="Daniel Pelzer" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Daniel Pelzer&#8217;s first experiences with the University of Iowa happened years ago, amidst the towering exhibits inside the Museum of Natural History in Macbride Hall. </p>
<p>&#8220;I used to hang out in Macbride Hall as a kid while my mom shopped downtown,&#8221; Daniel said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always felt a personal connection to the city.&#8221;</p>
<p>After completing undergraduate studies at the University of Northern Iowa, Daniel returned to Iowa City as a student in the University of Iowa Roy J. and Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine. He expects to graduate in May 2012 and plans to pursue a residency in pediatrics. </p>
<p>Growing up on a farm in Tipton, Iowa, Daniel may not have known he would one day be a doctor, but his childhood interests suggested such a path. He knew he wanted to explore something related to science as a career&#8212;and that he wanted to work with people. He sought a field that could marry those interests. </p>
<p>&#8220;Medicine is a blend of science and personal interaction,&#8221; said Daniel. &#8220;It&#8217;s a perfect way to interact with people and help improve their lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the personal connection Daniel forged during those childhood visits to campus played a role in his decision to choose the UI, so did the financial support he has received.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was looking at other schools out of state,&#8221; Daniel said. &#8220;I came here because of the great scholarships Iowa offered.&#8221; Daniel continues to see that support now. &#8220;The donors&#8217; generosity doesn&#8217;t end with getting people in the door; they continue to support us throughout our education.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the recipient of multiple scholarships&#8212;including the Beisner Memorial Scholarship, the Iowa Medical Society Scholarship, and the Linder Family Scholarship&#8212;Daniel says meeting contributors at scholarship luncheons has been a personal highlight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Being able to put a face to a dollar amount is a great experience, for them and for me,&#8221; said Daniel. He plans to be a face of giving himself someday as well. </p>
<p>&#8220;I absolutely plan to give back when I&#8217;m able to do so. There are valuable programs here that need and deserve support, and so many ways my future money can benefit students.&#8221;</p>

		<description><![CDATA["Support from generous  donors impacted my college career more than I could have ever imagined."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/danette-kapler.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="Danette Kapler" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>When I first started as an editorial intern at The University of Iowa Foundation during the fall 2009 semester, I expected to learn more about writing, communications, and public relations in a higher-education setting. I gained a lot of experience in many different areas throughout the semester by writing stories, reading through various materials, and meeting with a variety of staff members about their careers. But I also learned something I did not expect—I learned about the impact that private support had on my college education and the vital role it will continue to play in the lives of University of Iowa students in the future.</p>
<p>As a journalism and mass communication major, I have been able to take advantage of the resources in the Philip D. Adler Journalism and Mass Communication Building. Built in 2005, the building received more than $6 million in private funding to make the construction possible. Prior to my internship, I did not pay attention to the names posted on the walls outside of classrooms and offices or the list of names on the large plaque near the entrance. Now I realize that those names represent individuals who care about the University, its students, and the journalism profession, and gave their hard-earned dollars to the building campaign to help ensure that journalism students’ education would be the best it could possibly be.</p>
<p>One of my favorite spots on the UI campus is the rotunda area in the Adler Journalism Building. It’s the perfect place for relaxing in between classes, studying, or catching up on the latest news on one of the television screens in the area. <strong>I know that without the support of generous donors, the rotunda where I spent hours of my college career would not exist.</strong> The building itself is not the only area where private support has had an impact. I have been able to utilize the technology and programs that are available in classrooms and resource centers. I have also had the opportunity to listen to many different guest speakers in a variety of different professions from all across the world who bring career advice and real-world perspectives to journalism classes.</p>
<p>After graduating from The University of Iowa in December 2009, I plan to move back to my hometown of Waterloo and one day pursue a career in higher education or government relations.  My college experiences have played a big role in my career aspirations, and I know that without donor support, many of these experiences would not have been possible. During my first three years as a UI student, I never really thought about philanthropy. I assumed that tuition costs paid for all of my education. After interning with The University of Iowa Foundation, I realize that support from generous donors impacted my college career more than I could have ever imagined, and will continue to impact students in the future. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/danae-cole.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="Danae Cole" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>The first day that Danae Cole walks into a patient&#8217;s room as a professional nurse—freshly graduated from The University of Iowa— she won&#8217;t be nervous.</p>
<p>The reason is simple: <strong>Contributors to the UI have helped the UI College of Nursing prepare Danae for her career in uniquely valuable ways.</strong></p>
<p>For instance, Danae, a Des Moines native, has had extensive experience working in the college&#8217;s Nursing Clinical Education Center (NCEC). The college has used gift funds to establish and operate NCEC, a 20,000—square—foot center that includes an 11-room practice clinic where Danae has learned to administer sophisticated care in simulated exam rooms and other lifelike settings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Working in NCEC has given me extra confidence,&#8221; Danae says, expressing her thanks to contributors who have helped make the experience possible. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been able to practice assesment and treatment skills in a safe environment where I can make and fix mistakes, and learn from them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Danae has also recieved financial assistance from the college, thanks to private gifts, and <strong>she is grateful for the scholarship support</strong> that has allowed her to devote herself to learning her profession. For instance, the college worked with Danae to design and independent honors project presenting her discoveries from a private trip to the Demorcatic Republic of Congo, where she worked with malaria and HIV/AIDS patients and helped vaccinate children in a local clinic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Receiving scholarships has made it possible for me to concentrate on my studies and bring my personal experiences into my education, and opportunities like the NCEC have really helped me prepare for the real world of nursing,&#8221; Danae who plans a career in women&#8217;s health and working with underserved populations, says. <strong>&#8220;I&#8217;m pursuing all my goals at the UI. It&#8217;s been a great experience!&#8221;</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/athletics1.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="athletics" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Growing up a wrestler in Coggon, Iowa, <strong>Dan LeClere</strong> always pictured himself wrestling for the Iowa Hawkeyes. He grew up attending Iowa wrestling meets with his dad and participated in the Hawkeye Kids Wrestling School, so he became familiar at an early age with the facilities and coaches at Iowa.</p>
<p>After winning four state titles for North-Linn High School, LeClere had a choice to make. He could not see himself wrestling for any other coaching staff besides Tom Brands’s. LeClere had been introduced to the coaches at a young age and grew up idolizing them. But Brands became the head coach at Virginia Tech after being an assistant coach with the Hawkeyes from 1993 until 2004. After years of dreaming of wearing Hawkeye black and gold, LeClere followed Brands to Virginia Tech.</p>
<p>Now, LeClere has the best of both worlds—the coach and the team he’d always wanted. In 2006 Brands took the head coaching job for the Hawkeyes, and LeClere was one of the student-athletes who followed him.</p>
<p>Transferring to Iowa resulted in a loss of one year of eligibility for LeClere, but he knows he would not be as successful as he is now had he not returned to his home state. LeClere received the <strong>Nile Kinnick Leadership Scholarship</strong> for his successes. “Earning a scholarship named for Nile Kinnick gives me a feeling of accomplishment,” he says. “It’s good to know all of my hard work is paying off.”</p>
<p>LeClere realizes the difficulty in balancing academics with athletics and says his scholarship has helped him with some of the burdens of college life. “When you stop and think about it, the support really means a lot,” he says. “I can see myself giving back in different ways in the future because I know how much it helps out.” A senior biology major and an academic all-Big Ten honoree, LeClere plans to pursue a career as a chiropractor once he graduates from the UI. But first, he is looking forward to his last Hawkeye wrestling season, and he thanks the fans for their endless support.</p>
<p>“Hawkeye fans are the greatest fans there are,” LeClere says. “We know our fans are always going to be behind us.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/Courtney-Gent.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="Courtney Gent" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>A job-shadowing experience in high school paved the way for Courtney Gent, who will graduate from the UI College of Pharmacy in May of 2012. &#8220;I really enjoyed my experience shadowing a hospital pharmacist, and I realized pharmacists are a very important element of patient care,&#8221; notes Courtney. Courtney completed three years of undergraduate studies at Iowa before being accepted into the College of Pharmacy. She&#8217;s glad to be at Iowa, and credits lab simulations and classroom experiences, along with job-shadowing opportunities, for giving her a solid academic foundation. </p>
<p>The Wellman, Iowa, native has been the recipient of several scholarships while enrolled at the UI, including a Pharmacy Tuition Scholarship, the Schlumberger Estate Scholarship, and the H. Curtis Snyder Scholarship. </p>
<p>&#8220;Scholarships make a tremendous impact on a student’s college education and experience,&#8221; says Courtney. They&#8217;ve allowed me to focus on academics, volunteer in the profession, and hold leadership roles in student organizations, without worrying as much about the cost of tuition.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/christopher-blanco.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="Christopher Blanco" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>California native Christopher Blanco had three main priorities for selecting a law school: &#8220;I wanted good academics, resources to work with, and the opportunity to work for a football team,&#8221; said Christopher. He found all three-and more-at the University of Iowa. </p>
<p>Christopher is in his final year in the University of Iowa College of Law, and he also works as a football recruiting intern for the Hawkeyes. He came to the UI after completing undergraduate studies in sociology at Dartmouth College and has been seizing opportunity ever since. </p>
<p>Christopher is a member of the Latino/a American Law School Association and a co-founder of the Sports Law Society, and he worked with Professor Johnson in the College of Law to start a new course in sports law. After graduation in May 2012, he would like to carry what he&#8217;s learned at the UI in law and sports to the National Football League, hopefully working in player personnel. </p>
<p>Christopher counts private support among the reasons he&#8217;s had such valuable Iowa opportunities. He is the recipient of the Law Opportunity Fellowship and the Thurgood Marshall Legal Education Opportunity Program Fellowship, and he knows how he plans to show his gratitude for such support.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going out, getting my degree, and representing the UI is the best thanks I can give,&#8221; Christopher said. He also plans to return the favor someday. </p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve benefited a lot from the professors who have gone above and beyond for me. If my gift can help enable them to continue doing that, then it&#8217;s worth it.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/Chris-Page.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="Chris Page" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>On the surface, it seems like Chris Page opted to stay close to home for college. The Iowa City native first started taking classes at The University of Iowa during his senior year of high school and chose to enroll for undergraduate studies after receiving a UI Presidential Scholarship. But while at Iowa, this political science and geography double major has taken three separate study-abroad trips to China and another to London. His time in China during the 2008 earthquake was especially life-changing, and led him to pick up the geography major–hoping to one day help solve international environmental problems.</p>
<p>Chris’s life on campus is equally exciting. He serves as finance chair for the UI Lecture Committee, and played a key role in partnering with the UI Office of Sustainability to bring environmentalist Bill McKibben to Iowa City. He’s also in the UI Honors Program, and was recently awarded a prestigious Truman Scholarship for graduate studies. </p>
<p>This ambitious student credits his full-tuition Presidential Scholarship for allowing him to have a well-rounded college experience, without worrying about debt.</p>
<p>&#8220;That support really made it for me,&#8221; Chris said. &#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine what life would be like if I was in lots of debt. I feel very grateful that I have the support of so many generous donors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chris hopes to &#8220;pay it forward&#8221; after he graduates. </p>
<p>&#8220;People would be surprised at how even a small donation can make a difference in a student’s life,&#8221; Chris said, explaining why he hopes to support the UI in the future. &#8220;Now that I&#8217;ve had all of these amazing opportunities, I want to continue that giving.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/cassie-gonzales.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="Cassie Gonzales" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p><strong>When Cassie Gonzales received the UI&#8217;s Opportunity at Iowa scholarship</strong>, given to students of minority heritage with high academic achievement, she jumped at the chance to come to the UI to study anthropology.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love to study people,&#8221; the Tucson, Arizona, native says.</p>
<p>To Cassie&#8217;s delight, she&#8217;s found that the <strong>interdisciplinary structure</strong> of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences is allowing her to study people in more ways than one.</p>
<p>In addition to the coursework for her anthropology major, Cassie is exploring other disciplines. She&#8217;s studying playwriting through the Department of Theatre Arts. She&#8217;s taking classes through the School of Journalism and Mass Communication. And with Cassie&#8217;s curious mind and the almost inexhaustible offerings of the college, only time will tell where her interests take her next. </p>
<p>A voracious reader and a talented artist&#8212;she teaches children&#8217;s art classes through the Tucson parks department during the summer&#8212;Cassie has found other projects of the college to her liking as well. She&#8217;s enjoyed the <strong>Iowa New Play Festival</strong>, for instance, and she attends readings made possible by the <strong>Iowa Writers&#8217; Workshop</strong> and the <strong>Department of English</strong>. </p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a fun experience,&#8221; Cassie says. &#8220;I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing where my education takes me. It&#8217;s great that the college makes it so easy to explore different things while still focusing on my major.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cassie is precisely the kind of bright, eager student who thrives in the <strong>wide-ranging creative and intellectual atmosphere of the college</strong>. And that comprehensive learning environment is made possible in large part by the thousands of contributors who give each year to the college or one or more of its departments. </p>
<p>People studying people, in many different ways: That&#8217;s what the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences is all about. And Cassie&#8217;s ready to dig in.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/brett-vandersloten.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="Brett Vandersloten" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Emerging from the Kinnick Stadium tunnel and swarming the field with teammates in front of 70,000 Hawkeye faithful was something <strong>Brett Van Sloten</strong> knew he wanted to do in college. Now a junior, the Hawkeye offensive lineman is thankful to have the opportunity to do that, and more, at the University of Iowa.</p>
<p>&#8220;The coaches and players, the rich traditions, and the business school&#8211;my time at Iowa has been a great experience so far,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>While football and the academic reputation of Iowa were draws for Brett, he also counts private support among the reasons he chose to don the black and gold.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was looking at other schools, but Iowa offered me a scholarship,&#8221; Brett says. And that made all the difference for him.</p>
<p>Brett has received support from the Al Grady Memorial Football Scholarship and the Arthur E. Stanley Football Scholarship Fund, and that support has given him what he calls &#8220;the opportunity of a lifetime&#8221; to play football at Iowa. But football is not all he has been thankful for in his time so far on campus.</p>
<p>The Decorah, Iowa, native and business management major has had rich experiences beyond the field of play as well. Throughout the summer of 2012, he took his business education beyond the classroom through an internship opportunity at the UI Foundation. Among the many benefits of the experience, his time at the foundation deepened his appreciation for the impact of private support on student-athletes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It takes a lot of support to run a successful football program,&#8221; he says. &#8220;The scholarships at Iowa are so important, and the facilities are great. And because of donors, guys like me get a chance to play here.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/athletics1.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="athletics" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Iowa Hawkeye defensive back <strong>Brett Greenwood</strong> knows a thing or two about the value of athletic scholarships. </p>
<p>The starting free safety—named a 2010 preseason honorable mention All-American by NationalChamps.net—was a walk-on as a freshman at Iowa after his multi-position career at Pleasant Valley High School in Bettendorf, Iowa. He knows that every student-athlete with a scholarship had to work hard to receive the honor, but having to earn his as a walk-on made it all the sweeter.</p>
<p>“It felt great to get the recognition,” says Brett, who has received the <strong>Ben Trickey Memorial Scholarship</strong>, the <strong>Jack and Ailene Liechty Football Scholarship</strong>, and the <strong>Wallace Geiger Scholarship</strong>. “My hard work paid off.” </p>
<p>Brett, a marketing major, also worked as an intern for the Athletic Development Office at The University of Iowa Foundation during the summer of 2010. There he got to see firsthand the generosity and loyalty of many Hawkeye fans who step up to ensure that he and other UI student-athletes can earn a world-class education while wearing the black and gold.</p>
<p>“If not for them, we wouldn’t get our education and get to play for the Hawkeyes,” he says. “We’re provided with everything we need to succeed as players and academically.”</p>
<p>Brett, who for the fourth straight year was chosen in 2010 by his teammates to be a member of the Hawkeyes Leadership Group, knows he’ll always look back and remember all the ways Hawkeye fans support their team. </p>
<p>“When you come down that tunnel with the team and Kinnick Stadium opens up, there’s nothing like it,” he says. And he has a message for everyone who helps his teammates and him succeed: “Thank you for contributing throughout the year—and especially on football Saturdays.” </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/april-bachinski.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="April Bachinski" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>&#8220;Thanks to generous alumni and friends, I can learn what I need to know to make a difference in my patients&#8217; lives, day in and day out.&#8221;</p>
<p>During her very first clinical rotation, in the adult oncology unit, April Bachinski realized that she had embarked upon a truly rewarding journey by enrolling in the UI College of Nursing. What she learned during this first rotation was remarkable—and it was just one of many eye-opening experiences she&#8217;s had in the college&#8217;s Master of Science in Nursing: Clinical Nurse Leader program. April feels confident that these opportunities will help her fulfill her goal of working as a staff nurse at UI Hospitals and Clinics—and perhaps, one day, becoming a traveling nurse.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/andy-hunsberger.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="Andy Hunsberger" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Not many think of a performing arts center as having &#8220;alumni.&#8221; But for the UI graduates who serve as ushers, backstage hands, caf&eacute; workers, and box office cashiers, their time at Hancher Auditorium is a central&#8212;and often life-changing&#8212;part of their UI student experience.</p>
<p>Private support from contributors helps <strong>fund some Hancher student positions and create invaluable learning opportunities</strong> for UI students each year.</p>
<p>Andy Hunsberger, who worked at Hancher for nearly five years before graduating in December 2005, agrees that the experience has been invaluable.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve loved working at Hancher more than I can put into words,&#8221; says Andy. &#8220;I&#8217;ve gotten to see so many incredible performances, which have provided an amazing arts education.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve also built close relationships with other staff members&#8212;people with a broad range of backgrounds and interests that I probably wouldn&#8217;t have met otherwise. <strong>The experience has really enriched my UI education.</strong>&#8220;</p>
<p>Andy served as an usher for the first three years of his Hancher career and was promoted to house manager during the 2004-2005 season. In this role, he oversaw the student usher staff&#8212;helping with hiring, training, and supervising ushers, problem-solving during performances, and a variety of other high-responsibility tasks.</p>
<p>Andy, who plans to become a high school history teacher, is grateful to Hancher and its supporters for helping to make this learning opportunity possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>Working at Hancher really helped me mature and figure out my identity</strong> during my college years. I feel more well rounded, more cultured, and more confident as a result of the experience.&#8221; </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/andrew-thomas.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="Andrew Thomas" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Andrew Thomas likes to think fast.</p>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s making cases as president of the UI Mock Trial Club or cracking jokes as a member of the improvisational comedy group Paperback Rhino, Andrew needs to be able to <strong>work with complex ideas and turn them around quickly and concisely</strong>.</p>
<p>He chose the right UI college.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most important part of what I&#8217;ve learned in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences is how to communicate well&#8212;writing, articulation, and persuasion skills,&#8221; Andrew says. &#8220;With those abilities, I feel like I&#8217;ll be able to go in any direction I choose.&#8221;</p>
<p>Andrew, a UI Presidential Scholar, has been setting the stage for those choices -– including attending Yale Law School –- by taking advantage of opportunities in the college to make the most of his UI experience. With support from the college&#8217;s Dewey Stuit Fund&#8212;designed to support students&#8217; research&#8212;and other resources made possible by gifts large and small, Andrew has <strong>delved into his education and taken it beyond the classroom</strong>. For instance, he&#8217;s helped political science professor Brian Lai compile a searchable database of global terrorist incidents and research the role of the U.S. in halting international money laundering.</p>
<p>Andrew served as president of the college&#8217;s Dean&#8217;s Student Advisory Council&#8212;working with the dean&#8217;s office on issues of importance to students&#8212;and and as the chief of staff and public relations executive for UI Student Government. An active member of the Honors Program, he was awarded the Collegiate Scholar Award, and was selected to speak at the CLAS commencement ceremony in 2006, at which he graduated with highest distinction and honors. Andrew was also awarded a Hancher-Finkbine Medallion by the UI, as recognition of his outstanding academic success and service to the University. </p>
<p>He&#8217;s thankful for the ways that private support has helped him excel in his studies&#8212;and mindful of the effects of private gifts on the college as a whole.</p>
<p>&#8220;My Presidential Scholarship has helped me focus on what I&#8217;m most interested in,&#8221; Andrew says. &#8220;And <strong>helping one student do his best work</strong>, by making unique opportunities available, raises the bar for all students.&#8221;</p>

		<description><![CDATA["Each award makes me think more grandly about the world—and makes me feel more empowered to change it for the better."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/ali-keenan.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="Ali Keenan" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>As a nine-year-old in Urbandale, Iowa, Ali Keenan accompanied her dad, a firefighter, to a free flu-shot clinic that he had organized at the fire station for low-income members of the community. It was the first time Ali realized that not everybody had access to medical care.</p>
<p>“I didn’t understand,” said Ali, a Presidential Scholar who will graduate from the UI next May with degrees in engineering, biochemistry, and international studies. “And I didn’t think it was fair. The sense of injustice drove me crazy.”</p>
<p>Ali’s passion for fairness continues to motivate her, while her clear-eyed vision for the future and knack for problem-solving have already helped her find ways to start correcting health-care injustices, all over the world. </p>
<p>Last year, working with College of Engineering professor Craig Just (also the coordinator of sustainability programs for the college), Ali and a team of 14 of her classmates from the college’s chapter of Engineers for a Sustainable World created a handheld, hand-cranked device that turns salt water into chlorine bleach. The device can be assembled almost anywhere, using about five dollars’ worth of  readily available materials—a recycled plastic soda bottle, for instance—and generates enough bleach with each use to kill the disease-causing microorganisms in about five gallons of water. That could mean the difference between life and death for millions; by some estimates, 5,000 children worldwide die each day from diarrhea-related diseases, most of which are attributable to unsafe water supply.</p>
<p><em>Discover</em> magazine selected the device as one of its “10 Everyday Technologies that Can Change the World,” saying that, “For the roughly 1.2 billion people lacking clean water, a bit of chlorine could go a long way toward providing it.” The invention also won first place in the Environmental Protection Agency’s fourth annual People, Prosperity, and the Planet (P3 Awards) competition—an honor that awarded the team $75,000 to further develop the project.</p>
<p>Those accolades alone would be enough to warrant attention—and admiration—for Ali Keenan. But at age 23, with support from contributors to the University through the UI Foundation, Ali has already amassed an impressive résumé of experiences that merge her skills of invention with her genuine concern for the needs of people in the developing world. She has cared for HIV-positive orphans in Mexico and provided cervical-cancer screenings and entrepreneurship assistance to impoverished women in India. She works with the UI Mobile Clinic to provide free cholesterol and diabetes screenings for underserved patients in the Iowa City area. For her senior design project, she is developing a cheap and portable optical test to detect malaria in the field—and she just spent the summer in India, teaching clinicians techniques for diagnosing leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease that she has been researching in a UI lab for two years through the Iowa Center for Research by Undergraduates.</p>
<p>You won’t catch Ali gloating about her considerable accomplishments, though—in fact, she seems a little embarrassed by the attention of being the “it” girl on campus these days. </p>
<p><strong>“I’m just learning as much as I can, and trying to do some good along the way,”</strong> she said. “I’ve been very lucky to find great mentors and financial support, both of which have been 100 percent necessary in helping me achieve my goals.”</p>
<p>Thankfully for all of us, the UI and its contributors have been here to help Ali channel her passions into practical solutions to some of the world’s most intractable problems. The significant support she’s received to pay for her education and to fund her trips and research, through numerous scholarships and through funds supported by contributors to her academic programs, has empowered Ali to reach for goals that few can imagine.</p>
<p><strong>“From the time I got my first scholarship, every ounce of support has opened new doors of opportunity.</strong> Each award makes me think more grandly about the world—and makes me feel more empowered to change it for the better.”</p>
<p>That’s the power of investing in especially promising University of Iowa students. In Ali’s case, the multiplying effect of student support has already saved lives in far-flung places. There’s no telling how many lives she will save or improve as she makes her way in the world. She wants to continue working to put existing medical technologies into the hands of people who need them by making them simpler and more affordable, and by engineering social programs to deliver the tools to wherever they are most needed.</p>
<p>Charitable giving will probably help sustain Ali’s career for years to come, considering that delivering diagnostic tools and medicines to the developing world is not exactly a high-profit pursuit.</p>
<p><strong>“I feel good about reaching out to the world on behalf of the generous people who have supported my education,”</strong> Ali said. “And I have faith that I’ll be able to count on that generosity as long as I want to continue this kind of work.”</p>

<p>No matter what career he chooses—perhaps as an international diplomat, a Peace Corps employee, or an English teacher in a foreign country—Alex knows that an outstanding education from the UI College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (CLAS) will equip him to make a positive impact in the world.</p>
<p>In addition to his major coursework in political science and international studies, Alex is exploring other disciplines. Studying a wide range of topics from history to film theory, and from Chinese to design for the developing world, <strong>Alex is getting a remarkably broad education</strong>—and making important connections in the process.</p>
<p>Alex is learning comprehensive communication and critical-thinking skills that will prepare him to be a knowledgeable citizen of the 21st century and empower him to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing world.</p>
<p>&#8220;I chose the UI because I want to learn as much as possible, without limitations,&#8221; Alex says. &#8220;My interests are diverse, and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences is the perfect place to explore them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was impressed with the academic standards here, and getting a Presidential Scholarship helped finalize my decision. It validated my past work, and made me want to continue to excel.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Private support helps provide the resources</strong> for Alex—and other high-caliber UI students—to do just that.</p>
<p>Gifts to CLAS—or any of its more than 40 departments, schools, and programs—help provide support for great professors, access to up-to-the-minute technology, and an ever-changing slate of public lectures, performances, and exhibitions that make the UI campus an exciting place to learn.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m never bored here, and <strong>the learning never stops</strong>,&#8221; Alex says.</p>
<p>Thanks in large part to thoughtful and loyal contributors to the UI College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, it never will.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/adam-haluska.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="Aadam Haluska" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>When Adam Haluska was growing up in Carroll, Iowa, he idolized former Hawkeye men&#8217;s basketball greats Chris Street and Jess Settles, and fantasized about wearing the black and gold himself one day.</p>
<p>Now—after a brief detour at Iowa State—he&#8217;s realized his dream.</p>
<p>&#8220;To be in that Iowa locker room is an overwhelming feeling,&#8221; says Adam, a starting guard. &#8220;<strong>I&#8217;m thankful to be able to step on the court</strong> for every practice or game.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hawkeye fans are thankful that Adam&#8217;s there, too:</p>
<ul>
<li>He&#8217;s an ironman—as of the end of the 2005-2006 season, he&#8217;d started all 98 games in his career, the 10th-longest streak in the nation heading into the 2006-07 season.</li>
<li>He was the 2006 winner of the Chris Street Award, named in honor of Adam&#8217;s Hawkeye hero and presented annually to an Iowa player who best exemplifies the spirit, enthusiasm, and intensity of Chris Street (Street died in an auto accident January 19, 1993, midway through his junior year).</li>
<li>He&#8217;s been named all-Big Ten, academic all-Big Ten, and academic all-American.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, <strong>Adam gives everything he&#8217;s got to his University</strong>.</p>
<p>And he&#8217;s inspired to do so in part by all those who give so much to support him and his fellow Hawkeye student-athletes—from the cheering fans to the contributors who endow scholarships through the <a href="/athletics/endowment/">Hawkeye Visions initiative</a> to the thousands of <a href="/athletics/clubs.shtml">I-Club members</a> who help the UI cover the day-to-day costs of Hawkeye athletics.</p>
<p>&#8220;People take for granted what it takes to have an athletics program,&#8221; Adam says. &#8220;Every time I go to an I-Club event, I&#8217;m amazed at how many people I meet who just want to make sure that my teammates and I have <strong>the best experience and the best education possible</strong>. It&#8217;s what makes Iowa a great University.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/abdul-hodge.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="Abdul Hodge" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>Iowa football players Chad Greenway and Abdul Hodge come from vastly different backgrounds, one rural and the other urban. But they have an unbreakable bond that&#8217;s stronger than any differences: <strong>Iowa Hawkeye pride</strong>.</p>
<p>Chad and Abdul are two of the premier linebackers in the nation. Iowa&#8217;s Big Ten and national rivals would love to have these pre-season All-Americans—both are on the watch lists for the Chuck Bednarik Award, the Lott Trophy, and the Lombardi Award—but these dedicated Hawkeyes wouldn&#8217;t trade the experience of playing for Head Coach Kirk Ferentz in Kinnick Stadium for anything.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kinnick Stadium is one of the greatest places I&#8217;ve ever played,&#8221; says Chad. &#8220;No matter the weather, <strong>the fans are always there, showing how much they love the Hawkeyes</strong>. It&#8217;s a unique environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chad and Abdul say Iowa fans&#8217; financial support is another message they and their fellow student-athletes hear loud and clear.</p>
<p>&#8220;I enjoy talking with I-Club groups and thanking them for all they do for us,&#8221; says Abdul. &#8220;From scholarships to the Kinnick Stadium renovation to things like the Gerdin Athletic Learning Center, <strong>we all really appreciate their support</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks to I-Club members and other contributors, the future is bright for well-educated, talented UI student-athletes like Chad and Abdul. And no matter where these two go after graduating, they will always share a common heritage, forged on the football field in Hawkeye black and gold.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="480" height="300" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/04/aaron-porter.jpg" class="attachment-full wp-post-image" alt="Aaron Porter" style="float:left; margin:0px;" /><p>As a Ph.D. student at the University of Iowa College of Public Health, Aaron Porter is no stranger to the university classroom experience. Before coming to the UI, he attended two other schools to earn bachelor’s and master’s degrees, and the caliber of teaching and collaboration at Iowa stands out.</p>
<p>“Every day I walk through the doors of the College of Public Health, I’m happier and happier I chose to come here,” says Aaron, who is from a northern Chicago suburb. “I knew within 24 hours of visiting that this was the school I would attend—I could feel the camaraderie between faculty and students within the department.”</p>
<p>This camaraderie is important to Aaron, because he believes a significant part of the learning experience comes from conversations with faculty and other students outside of the classroom. The UI is ideal, he says, for this kind of interaction. “Within the first three weeks of my courses here, I could feel the difference,” Aaron says. The strength of the relationship between faculty, students, and education will only increase when the new academic building for the college is completed, something Aaron is eagerly anticipating.</p>
<p>Aaron, who was drawn to biostatistics because of the immediate, tangible impact the work can have on the world, will benefit from private gifts not only through his use of the new facility, but also as both a teaching and research assistant.</p>
<p>These and other contributions to the department are being used effectively, which Aaron says is evident in the solid program and reputation the college has built in its 10-year history, and are helping it continue to grow and improve. If his plans to teach at an institution that combines teaching and research lead him back to Iowa City one day, Aaron would be happy to consider the opportunity.</p>
