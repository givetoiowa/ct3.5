				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float:right;padding-left:10px;"><iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/k-lCiLCiVXA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Mark Bogue of Ida Grove, Iowa graduated from the University of Iowa in 1982 with a B.S. in civil engineering with an emphasis in structural design. Following graduation he worked in Peoria, Illinois for Caterpillar Tractor Company. He credits Caterpillar’s extensive training program for preparing him for the multitude of tasks an engineer needs to be prepared for in either working for a large company or managing his own business.</p>
<p>He moved on from there to Dallas, Texas where he took a position with Texas Instruments in the early stages of the production of the HARM missile. During this time he married Jaclyn, a 1983 University of Iowa graduate from the business college.</p>
<p>After a few years in Dallas and some discussion of starting a family, they decided to accept an offer from his father to return back to Iowa and become involved in Hi-Way Products, Inc., a business that his father started in 1969. Hi-Way Products, Inc. was a growing business and at a stage to expand its product line and geographic sales area. Hi-Way</p>
<p>Products, Inc. is the leading supplier of custom fabricated steel products for the highway bridge industry and highway guardrail and safety products utilized on bridges and along roadways in Iowa. They represent steel fabricators in four different states.</p>
<p>In 1999 Mark and his father had grown the business to the point where they felt it necessary to own their own steel fabrication company. Hawkeye Fabrication, Inc. was started that year and has become a successful part of their corporate strategy. In 2000 Mark and Jaclyn purchased both of the businesses from his father. Mark is currently the president of both companies.</p>
<p>The I-235 Interstate Reconstruction project through Des Moines, Iowa during 2003 to 2008 is a project that his companies are extremely proud of, with approximately 40 bridges utilizing their decorative fabricated handrails and other products.</p>
<p>Mark and Jaclyn have three children and they are very proud to say they are all Hawkeyes! Two sons , both of which have recently graduated from the college of engineering and a daughter that is currently a sophomore in the Health Sciences.</p>
<p>Mark enjoys getting involved with organizations he believes in. He has been an involved member of the College of Engineering Development Council for over 10 years. In late 2012, he accepted the position as Chair of the Engineering Campaign Task Force for the “For Iowa. Forever More” campaign.</p>
<p>Mark has also served on the BC-IG Community School Board for eight years, serving as vice president for four of those years. He was a member of the Ida Grove Community Fire Dept. for thirteen years. He has also achieved the rank of 3rd Degree Black belt in Tae Kwon Do.</p>
<p>He enjoys boating, water and snow skiing, bicycling, motorcycling, collecting fine wines and travel.</p>
<p><em><strong>“With three generations of U of I engineering graduates in our family, we take great pride in being involved and giving back financially to the college that has given our family so many wonderful opportunities. We understand that the college can utilize our support in numerous ways to benefit the next generation of engineering students. Jacki and I truly believe that the college motto of educating &#8220;Engineers&#8230; and something more&#8221; is developing the most versatile engineers for the future.”</strong></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="size-full wp-image-406" style="padding-left: 10px;" alt="Thomas R. Hanson" src="http://www.uifoundation.org/stories/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2013/07/hanson.jpg" width="106" height="166" align="right" />A native of Moline, IL, Tom Hanson graduated from The University of Iowa in 1960 in mechanical engineering. Following graduation, he worked for Union Carbide Corporation in Charleston, WV. Hanson’s career then led him to The Trane Company, La Crosse, WI, and another firm in Winston-Salem, NC. Three years later, Hanson moved to suburban Chicago, where he ran the regional sales office of York International. After years in the heating and cooling industry, he integrated his expertise in engineering, business, sales, and communications and started his own company in 1980, Fleming Hanson Sales. The Chicago-based company, from which Hanson retired in 2000, contracts with various heating and cooling manufacturers as exclusive regional sales representatives.</p>
<p>Inspired by his own career experiences and deep commitment to his alma mater, Hanson and his wife, Nancy, endowed the Hanson Center for Technical Communication in the College of Engineering. Through this innovative center, today’s students have a comprehensive resource for developing excellent communication skills as part of the engineering education – skills Hanson felt were too often missing among engineers. He especially enjoys staying in touch with the student peer consultants and staff members so he can observe the progress this unique center is making.</p>
<p>Hanson served as a member and chair of the College of Engineering Development Council during the Good. Better. Best. Iowa campaign and is currently Chair of The University of Iowa Foundation Board of Directors. In 2010, he received The University of Iowa Alumni Association Distinguished Alumni Award for Service.</p>
<p><strong><em>“I give to the College of Engineering because I know private support is essential to funding the College’s commitment to providing the highest quality educational experience for its students. Whether that means new facilities, new programs, scholarships or student travel opportunities, private support makes it happen. The knowledge that my support makes a positive difference in the education these students receive is highly gratifying.”</em></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We continue to make great progress towards our campaign goal. Check out the For Iowa Forever More sharepoint site for some recent gift highlights. Thanks to the development officers, communications staff, administrative support staff and any others who helped on these gifts. This is one of the best ways to become more engaged in the campaign.</p>
<p>As you will see we have more information on some of the gifts than others. We want to make sure we share any good giving stories so if you have any, let me know. The success of our campaign will come from dollars raised, but more importantly, from the impact those dollars make. In a recent CASE Current article on campaign communications a veteran communicator said: “A campaign without human stories about impacts tells only half the story.”</p>
<p>We are gradually approaching the $1 billion mark, and will soon pass not only that milestone, but will exceed the amount raised in our previous Good Better Best Iowa Campaign. We will mark that day with some form of special recognition. Beginning in April we will have a number of key campus events dealing with the UIF and the campaign. They are listed below. Keep them in mind. And thanks to all of the staff who are working to plan these events.</p>
<ul>
<li>April 1-5 CCOM and UIHC faculty/staff campaign</li>
<li>April 22-26 Levitt Center staff campaign</li>
<li>April 30 Levitt Center recognition event 3-5 pm</li>
<li>May 2 Phils Day</li>
<li>May 3 (In conjunction with UIF Board meeting)</li>
<li>8-10 am Campaign Steering Committee meeting</li>
<li>Evening Campaign Kickoff</li>
<li>May 4 Unit Kickoff events (TBA)</li>
<li>June 15 Arts Campus groundbreaking</li>
<li>September 9-20 Main Campus Faculty/Staff campaign kickoff</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Check the FIFM campaign sharepoint site to see how the new goal and timeline impacts our featured unit progress. We also have our first two case statements from Nursing and Public Health. We are 186 days from the public kickoff. And remember, “Great moments are born from great opportunity.”</p>
<p>And here are some talking points about the increased goal</p>
<ul>
<li>Although this is truly an aspirational goal, we are confident we can reach it. It is within the range suggested by the GGA planning study, by our strategic plan growth figures of 5%, and our assessment of the prospect data base</li>
<li>We have confidence in our UIF staff can help us maximize the amount of support by finding, cultivating and soliciting our very best prospects.   In fact we think this is a great opportunity to demonstrate just how good a staff we have here at the UIF.</li>
<li>Campaigns are opportunities to mobilize for significantly larger asks</li>
<li>We  know there are unknown gifts out there.</li>
<li>We think there are a few units who may increase their goal, but we will label the remaining amount as &#8220;University Wide Priorities&#8221;</li>
<li>Remember our vision here at the UIF is &#8220;Inspiring Generosity, Exceeding Expectations&#8221; We are not just thinking about generosity and meeting expectations , we are inspiring and exceeding.</li>
</ul>
